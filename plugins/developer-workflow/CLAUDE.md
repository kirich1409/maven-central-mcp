## Plugin family

This plugin is part of a split family. Depending on the task, Claude Code will have access to agents from sibling plugins:

| Plugin | Contributes |
|---|---|
| `developer-workflow` (this) | 14 lifecycle skills + `manual-tester` |
| `developer-workflow-experts` | `code-reviewer`, `architecture-expert`, `security-expert`, `performance-expert`, `ux-expert`, `build-engineer`, `devops-expert`, `business-analyst`, `debugging-expert` — required, auto-installed as a dependency |
| `developer-workflow-kotlin` | `kotlin-engineer`, `compose-developer`; skills `code-migration`, `kmp-migration`, `migrate-to-compose` — install for Kotlin/Android/KMP work |
| `developer-workflow-swift` | `swift-engineer`, `swiftui-developer` — install for Swift/iOS/macOS work |

Skills in this plugin delegate to engineer agents (kotlin-engineer / compose-developer / swift-engineer / swiftui-developer) by short name via the Task tool. Agent names are unique across the family, so short-name resolution works as long as the corresponding platform plugin is installed. If `implement` or `write-tests` is invoked and the referenced engineer is not installed, the Task call will fail with a clear message — install the matching platform plugin and retry.

## Conventions

- Self-contained core: lifecycle orchestration only. No platform-specific engineers live here.
- **Dependency policy:** only built-in Claude Code features + sibling plugins from this family (via `dependencies` in plugin.json). No third-party plugins.
- **MCP servers:** `mobile` MCP is explicitly allowed for testing (used by `manual-tester`, `acceptance`, `bug-hunt`). Other MCP servers (Perplexity, DeepWiki, Context7) are environment-level — skills must NOT hardcode tool names or break without them. Describe the task, not the tool.
- **External tools:** if a capability requires something the user may not have installed, describe what's needed and let the user decide.
- Skills use YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description` (≤ 1024 chars), optionally `disable-model-invocation`.
- `code-reviewer` (in `developer-workflow-experts`) is read-only — no Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, or Bash tools.
- Workspace directories (`*-workspace/`) are runtime artifacts, not skills. Gitignored.
- Pipeline orchestration rules live at `~/.claude/rules/dev-workflow-orchestration.md` (user-global, not in this repo).
- Quality Loop gates are defined in orchestration rules, not in any skill.

## Skills roster (14)

- Planning/research: `research`, `decompose-feature`, `write-spec`, `plan-review`
- Implementation: `implement`, `write-tests`, `debug`
- QA: `generate-test-plan`, `acceptance`, `bug-hunt`
- PR: `create-pr`, `triage-feedback`
- Orchestrators: `feature-flow`, `bugfix-flow`
