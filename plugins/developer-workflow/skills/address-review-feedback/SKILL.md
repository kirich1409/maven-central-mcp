  Use when the user has received review comments on a GitHub PR or GitLab MR and needs
  to process them — analyze, triage, coordinate fixes, respond, and resolve threads. This is THE skill
  for any post-review work on a PR/MR. Triggers on: "разберись с комментариями",
  "address review comments", "handle review feedback", "respond to reviewers",
  "fix review comments", "deal with PR/MR comments", "reply to review",
  "resolve review threads", "go through the feedback", "комментарии к PR/MR",
  "ревьюер оставил комментарии", "пройдись по комментариям", "тредов после ревью",
  "reviewer left comments", "got a review", "review feedback on my MR/PR",
  or any mention of processing, triaging, or responding to existing review comments
  on a pull request or merge request. Do NOT use for writing new reviews, creating PRs,
  or CI/CD monitoring — those are separate skills.

# Address Review Feedback

An orchestrator skill. Analyzes all review comments, categorizes them, detects
cross-diff patterns, presents an action plan for user confirmation, then coordinates
fixes, answers, and thread responses. Does NOT implement code changes itself — it
produces task descriptions for implementation agents.

**Core principle:** Fix what belongs to this PR. Push back when a suggestion is wrong.
Never perform agreement — just act and show evidence.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch & Parse

### Platform detection

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
# Contains github.com → GitHub (gh)
# Contains gitlab     → GitLab (glab)
```

### Fetch PR/MR metadata and context

Fetch both technical metadata and the PR/MR context — description, linked issues, labels,
milestone. This context is essential for Phase 2: understanding the intent behind changes
lets you judge whether a comment is in scope, whether a suggestion aligns with the goal,
and what trade-offs matter.

```bash
# GitHub — metadata + context in one call
PR_INFO=$(gh pr view --json number,baseRefName,headRefName,title,body,labels,milestone,closingIssuesReferences)
PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r .number)
BASE=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r .baseRefName)
PR_BODY=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r .body)
PR_LABELS=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '[.labels[].name] | join(", ")')
PR_MILESTONE=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '.milestone.title // empty')
LINKED_ISSUES=$(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '[.closingIssuesReferences[].number] | join(", ")')
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
OWNER=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
REPO_NAME=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)

# GitHub — if linked issues exist, fetch their bodies for context
# (issue description often contains acceptance criteria and requirements)
for ISSUE_NUM in $(echo "$PR_INFO" | jq -r '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'); do
  gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" --json title,body --jq '"\(.title): \(.body)"'
done

# GitLab — metadata + context
MR_INFO=$(glab mr view --output json)
MR_IID=$(echo "$MR_INFO" | jq -r .iid)
MR_BODY=$(echo "$MR_INFO" | jq -r .description)
MR_LABELS=$(echo "$MR_INFO" | jq -r '[.labels[]] | join(", ")')
MR_MILESTONE=$(echo "$MR_INFO" | jq -r '.milestone.title // empty')
PROJECT=$(glab repo view --output json | jq -r '.path_with_namespace')
BASE=$(echo "$MR_INFO" | jq -r .target_branch)

# GitLab — fetch linked issues (closing pattern in description: "Closes #123")
# Extract issue IIDs from description, then fetch each
echo "$MR_BODY" | grep -Eo '(Closes?|Fixes?|Resolves?) #[0-9]+' | sed 's/.*#//' | while read ISSUE_IID; do
  glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/issues/$ISSUE_IID" --jq '"\(.title): \(.description)"'
done
```

### Build the change context

Before analyzing comments, summarize what this PR/MR is about:

- **Goal** — from the PR/MR description and linked issue titles
- **Scope** — from labels, milestone, and the list of changed files
- **Requirements** — from linked issue bodies (acceptance criteria, constraints)

Use this context throughout Phase 2 to decide scope, priority, and whether to push back.

### Fetch all comments

Fetch every comment type separately — each endpoint returns different data.

```bash
# GitHub — inline review comments (attached to specific lines)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, in_reply_to_id, user:.user.login, path, line, body, created_at}]'

# GitHub — review summaries (top-level review objects with body text)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, user:.user.login, state, body, submitted_at}]'

# GitHub — PR-level issue comments (not inline, not review summaries)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, user:.user.login, body, created_at}]'

# GitLab — all discussions (inline, review summaries, and general notes in one call)
glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/merge_requests/$MR_IID/discussions" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, notes: [.notes[] | {id, author:.author.username, body, position:.position, resolved, created_at}]}]'
```

### Parse each comment

For each comment record, extract:
- **author** — reviewer username
- **location** — `file:line` for inline comments; `(review summary)` for top-level reviews; `(PR comment)` for issue comments
- **body** — full text
- **thread_state** — resolved / unresolved (GitHub: check `resolvedAt` on the thread node via GraphQL; GitLab: `notes[0].resolved`)
- **in_reply_to** — whether this is a reply in an existing thread (skip root analysis — reply context is part of the thread)

Skip already-resolved threads unless the resolution seems premature (e.g., reviewer resolved their own open question without getting an answer).

---

## Phase 2: Analyze & Categorize

### Read the diff

```bash
git diff "$BASE"...HEAD
```

Use the diff for two purposes: verifying suggestions are technically valid, and detecting repeated patterns.

### Assign one category per comment

| Category | When to assign |
|----------|---------------|
| **BLOCKING** | Security vulnerability, critical bug, compliance violation, data loss risk |
| **IMPORTANT** | Non-critical bug, missing error handling, logic error, missing test for a broken case |
| **SUGGESTION** | Refactoring opportunity, architectural improvement, better approach — no correctness risk |
| **NIT** | Naming, formatting, style, minor preferences with no functional impact |
| **QUESTION** | Reviewer asking for clarification — needs an answer, may or may not need a code change |
| **PRAISE** | Compliment or approval — no action needed |
| **OUT_OF_SCOPE** | Valid concern, but requires changes outside this PR's scope |

### Assess actionability per comment

| Actionability | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **FIXABLE** | Clear what to change — can be delegated directly |
| **NEEDS_CLARIFICATION** | Comment is ambiguous — must ask reviewer before acting |
| **DISCUSSION** | No single right answer — needs conversation with reviewer and/or user |
| **NO_ACTION** | Praise, already fixed, or demonstrably invalid |

### Verify before accepting

Before labeling a BLOCKING or IMPORTANT comment as FIXABLE, verify the suggestion:

1. Is it technically correct for this codebase?
2. Would it break existing functionality or tests?
3. Is there a documented reason the current code is written this way?
4. Does it apply to all platforms/versions targeted by this PR?

If any check fails → category stays, but actionability becomes DISCUSSION with a note on what's wrong with the suggestion.

### Detect patterns

For each BLOCKING, IMPORTANT, or SUGGESTION comment that points to a specific code pattern
(null check, error handling, naming convention, etc.):

1. Extract the problematic pattern from the diff at the referenced location
2. Search the rest of the diff for the same pattern in other files or lines
3. If found → note: `Pattern also at: file:line, file:line`

This prevents fixes that address the reported location but leave identical problems elsewhere.

### Group related comments

- Comments from different reviewers about the same logical issue → one group, one action item
- Multiple comments from the same reviewer about closely related concerns → one group if a single fix addresses all

Each group produces one action item in the plan.

---

## Phase 3: Present Plan

Show the full analysis before doing anything. Wait for user confirmation.

```markdown
## Review Feedback Analysis

### Summary
- X comments total across Y reviewers
- Z BLOCKING, A IMPORTANT, B SUGGESTION, C NIT, D QUESTION, E PRAISE, F OUT_OF_SCOPE
- G patterns detected (same issue in multiple locations)
- H comments need clarification before acting

### Action Plan

#### BLOCKING (must fix)
| # | Author | Location | Issue | Pattern? | Action |
|---|--------|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | @alice | auth.kt:45 | SQL injection via raw query | +2 locations | Fix in 3 files |

#### IMPORTANT (should fix)
| # | Author | Location | Issue | Pattern? | Action |
|---|--------|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 2 | @bob | session.kt:12 | Missing null check on token | none | Fix |

#### SUGGESTION (consider)
| # | Author | Location | Issue | Actionability | Action |
|---|--------|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 3 | @alice | order.kt:88 | Extract to separate function | FIXABLE | Fix (or decline — your call) |

#### QUESTION (answer needed)
| # | Author | Location | Question | Action |
|---|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| 4 | @carol | README.md | Why not use X approach here? | Answer in thread |

#### NIT (acknowledge only)
| # | Author | Location | Comment |
|---|--------|----------|---------|
| 5 | @bob | util.kt:3 | Trailing whitespace |

#### PRAISE (no action)
| # | Author | Comment |
|---|--------|---------|
| 6 | @alice | Looks clean! |

#### OUT_OF_SCOPE (your decision)
| # | Author | Issue | Recommendation |
|---|--------|-------|---------------|
| 7 | @carol | Entire auth module needs rework | Decline with note; log as follow-up issue if agreed |

### Proposed execution order
1. Seek clarification on NEEDS_CLARIFICATION items — pause until resolved
2. Fix BLOCKING #1 (3 files) — implementation agent task
3. Fix IMPORTANT #2 — implementation agent task
4. Address SUGGESTION #3 — awaiting your call (fix or decline)
5. Answer QUESTION #4 — reply in thread
6. Acknowledge NITs #5 — reply and resolve
7. OUT_OF_SCOPE #7 — awaiting your decision
```

**Wait for user response.** The user may:
- Approve as-is → proceed
- Re-categorize specific comments → update and proceed
- Skip specific items → remove from plan
- Add context or notes for specific items → incorporate into task descriptions or responses

---

## Phase 4: Execute

Execute in the order below. Do not proceed to the next step until the current one is complete.

### Step 1: Clarifications (if any NEEDS_CLARIFICATION items)

Reply to those threads asking for specifics. Ask all clarification questions in a single
round — one reply per ambiguous thread, all at once. Then pause and wait for reviewer
responses before proceeding with affected items.

```bash
# GitHub — reply to an inline review comment
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/replies" \
  --method POST -f body="<question text>"

# GitHub — reply to a top-level PR comment or review summary
gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "<question text>"

# GitLab — reply to a discussion note
glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/merge_requests/$MR_IID/discussions/$DISCUSSION_ID/notes" \
  --method POST -f body="<question text>"
```

### Step 2: Delegate fixes

For each approved fix group (BLOCKING / IMPORTANT / accepted SUGGESTION), produce a task
description for an implementation agent. Include:

- **What to fix** — exact issue as described by the reviewer
- **Where** — primary file:line + all pattern locations detected in Phase 2
- **Why** — reviewer's reasoning (quote directly where it adds clarity)
- **Constraints** — do not change code outside the listed locations; do not alter unrelated logic

Output these task descriptions. The main session orchestrator spawns the implementation
agents — this skill does not call agents directly.

### Step 3: Answer questions

For each QUESTION thread, derive the answer from code context (read the relevant file
and surrounding logic). Reply directly in the thread.

```bash
# Same reply commands as Step 1
```

### Step 4: Respond to all addressed comments

After fixes are committed, post responses. For declined suggestions, respond immediately
(no commit needed).

**Language matching.** Detect the language of the reviewer's comment body. Write your response
in that same language — if the reviewer wrote in Russian, reply in Russian; if in English,
reply in English. When a thread contains multiple comments in different languages, use the
language of the first (root) comment in the thread. Technical terms, code identifiers,
file paths, commit hashes, and code snippets always stay in their original form regardless
of the response language.

**Response rules — no performative agreement.** Never write "Great point!", "You're right!",
"Thanks for catching that!". State what changed and why, or state disagreement with evidence.

| Category | Response |
|----------|----------|
| BLOCKING / IMPORTANT (fixed) | `Fixed in <commit hash>. <One sentence: what changed and where.>` |
| BLOCKING / IMPORTANT (pushed back — suggestion is incorrect) | `<Technical reasoning with evidence from codebase. Reference file:line or test.> Keeping as-is.` |
| SUGGESTION (accepted, fixed) | `Addressed in <commit hash>. <What changed.>` |
| SUGGESTION (declined) | `Keeping as-is — <brief reason>. <Optional: "Logged as <issue> for follow-up.">` |
| NIT | `Noted. Not addressing in this PR to keep scope focused.` |
| QUESTION | The answer itself — complete, no fluff |
| PRAISE | *(no response — resolve silently)* |
| OUT_OF_SCOPE | Per user's decision from Phase 3 |

```bash
# GitHub — reply to inline review comment
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_ID/replies" \
  --method POST -f body="<response>"

# GitHub — reply to top-level comment or review summary
gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "<response>"

# GitLab — reply to discussion
glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/merge_requests/$MR_IID/discussions/$DISCUSSION_ID/notes" \
  --method POST -f body="<response>"
```

### Step 5: Resolve threads

Resolve threads where the issue is fully closed. Do NOT resolve if:
- Awaiting reviewer confirmation after a pushback
- The thread is marked DISCUSSION and no consensus has been reached
- NEEDS_CLARIFICATION items still awaiting reviewer reply

```bash
# GitHub — get thread node IDs (needed for GraphQL resolve mutation)
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$number:Int!) {
    repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo) {
      pullRequest(number:$number) {
        reviewThreads(first:100) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first:1) { nodes { body databaseId } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO_NAME" -F number="$PR_NUMBER"

# GitHub — resolve a thread by node ID
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($id:ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}) { thread { isResolved } }
  }
' -f id="<THREAD_NODE_ID>"

# GitLab — resolve a discussion
glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/merge_requests/$MR_IID/discussions/$DISCUSSION_ID" \
  --method PUT -f resolved=true
```

---

## Principles

**Push back when a suggestion is wrong.** If a reviewer's recommendation would introduce
a bug, violate a project pattern, or doesn't apply to this codebase — say so. Use technical
evidence: reference the file, the test, the documented behavior. Involve the user if the
disagreement is architectural.

**Pattern completeness.** A fix that addresses only the reported location while leaving
identical problems elsewhere is incomplete. Always check the full diff before marking
a comment resolved.

**One clarification round.** Batch all ambiguous items and ask in a single pass. Never
send clarification requests one at a time as they get resolved — wait until you have
all questions ready.

**Scope discipline.** OUT_OF_SCOPE comments are valid concerns — don't dismiss them.
Surface them clearly to the user with a recommendation (decline with note, or log as
a follow-up issue). The user decides; you execute that decision.

**Language matching.** Always respond in the language the reviewer used. If a reviewer
commented in Russian — reply in Russian; if in English — reply in English. Never switch
languages mid-response. Technical terms, code identifiers, file paths, and commit hashes
always stay in their original form.

**Tools priority:** CLI (gh / glab) → REST API → MCP.
