# Acceptance

Choreographer skill. Detects project type, confirms a verification source exists, fans out
parallel checks to specialized agents, aggregates verdicts into one receipt. Acceptance
executes a pre-existing verification contract — it does not invent checks. When no contract
is available, it halts and proposes the correct upstream skill.

---

## Vocabulary

Canonical values used throughout this skill. Downstream consumers (feature-flow, bugfix-flow,
create-pr) read these from the receipt.

- **`project_type`** — one of: `android`, `ios`, `web`, `desktop`, `backend-jvm`,
  `backend-node`, `cli`, `library`, `generic`. Source of truth: ORCHESTRATION.md §Project
  type detection.
- **`has_ui_surface`** — boolean derived from `project_type`. True for `android`, `ios`,
  `web`, `desktop`. False otherwise (`generic` → ask user).
- **`ecosystem`** — build stack: `gradle`, `node`, `rust`, `go`, `python`, `xcode`. Used for
  build-smoke command selection only; orthogonal to `project_type`.
- **Per-check verdict** — each sub-check reports `PASS | WARN | FAIL | SKIPPED`, plus
  `severity` (`critical | major | minor`), `confidence` (`high | medium | low`), and
  `domain_relevance` (`high | medium | low`) for aggregation.
- **Bug severity** — `P0 | P1 | P2 | P3`. Unchanged from prior receipt schema, primary axis
  for `feature-flow`/`bugfix-flow` routing.
- **Aggregated Status** — `VERIFIED | FAILED | PARTIAL`. Derived; see §Aggregation.

---

## Step 0: Detect Project Type

Follow the canonical heuristic in `plugins/developer-workflow/docs/ORCHESTRATION.md` §Project
type detection. Output: `project_type`, `has_ui_surface`, `ecosystem`.

**Override policy.** If the spec frontmatter `platform:` list is non-empty, **spec wins** —
take the first platform value as the canonical `project_type`. If the list has more than one
entry, record the full list separately as `platforms: [...]` in the receipt; do not invent a
`multi-platform` `project_type`. Record `project_type_override: spec` in the receipt. If the
user corrects detection mid-run, record `project_type_override: user`.

Step 0 file reads and Step 1 file reads are disjoint. You MAY issue both sets in one batched
Read call set to avoid serial round-trips.

---

## Step 1: Gather Inputs

Acceptance requires at least one verification source. If none is available, Step 1.5 halts.

### 1.1 Spec Source (optional if a test plan or debug.md is provided)

Accept any combination of: Figma mockups, PRD / requirements, acceptance criteria list, PR
description, GitHub/Linear issue. Read all provided sources.

**Read the spec frontmatter.** If present, load `platform`, `surfaces`, `risk_areas`,
`non_functional`, `acceptance_criteria_ids`, `design.figma`. These drive the conditional
triggers in Step 3 plus two invariant guards on the base plan:

- `ui ∈ surfaces` forces `manual-tester` into the fan-out when a scenario source exists,
  even if Step 0 detected a non-UI project (hybrid products with both UI and non-UI
  surfaces).
- `surfaces` set and does not contain `ui` on a UI-detected project means the spec
  explicitly excludes UI — skip `manual-tester` even if `has_ui_surface` is true, and note
  this in the Check Plan section of the receipt.

If the spec has no frontmatter (pre-iteration-2 specs, external specs, or plain-text issues)
— every conditional defaults to "not triggered" and `surfaces` is treated as unspecified;
only the base checks keyed off `has_ui_surface` run. This preserves backward compatibility.

### 1.2 Probe available artifacts (parallel)

Before branching, read the following in a single batched Read call set. Each may error-as-absent
— that is expected:

- `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` (receipt)
- `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` (permanent)
- `swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md` (bug-fix reproduction steps)

Combined with inline inputs and spec sources, one of the branches below fires. Record the
selected branch as `test_plan_source` in the receipt.

#### Branch 1 — Receipt present (`test_plan_source: receipt`)

**Condition:** `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` exists.

Read the receipt's YAML frontmatter and load `permanent_path`. Interpret `review_verdict` per
the canonical definition in `generate-test-plan/SKILL.md` §Receipt: treat `PASS` / `WARN` /
`skipped` as proceed; `FAIL` and `pending` as blockers that escalate back to the invoking
orchestrator or the user (acceptance is called from `feature-flow`, `bugfix-flow`, or
standalone — it does not assume which), recommending revision via `multiexpert-review`
before acceptance runs again. Pass the **permanent file** to `manual-tester` as the primary
test-plan source. If the receipt has a `platform:` field, use it as an additional input to
Step 0's override policy.

#### Branch 2 — Permanent file exists without receipt (`test_plan_source: mounted`)

**Condition:** Branch 1 did not fire **and** `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` exists on
disk without a matching receipt.

Acceptance owns the mount-receipt when invoked outside `feature-flow`. Emit a mount-receipt
at `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` following the canonical format in
`generate-test-plan/SKILL.md` §Receipt. Apply the mount overrides: `status: Mounted`,
`review_verdict: skipped`, `source_spec: existing (pre-orchestration)`. Derive
`phase_coverage` from the permanent file's phase headings; omit the field if coverage cannot
be determined reliably. Pass the permanent file to `manual-tester`.

#### Branch 3 — Inline test plan or spec available (`test_plan_source: on-the-fly`)

**Condition:** Branches 1 and 2 did not fire **and** the invocation provides a test plan
inline, a spec source, or both.

Three modes:

- **Test plan only (no spec)** — execute as-is; verdict depends on TC pass/fail.
- **Test plan + spec** — execute the plan, cross-reference against the spec, flag obvious gaps
  to the user ("spec mentions X but the test plan doesn't cover it — add a TC?").
- **Spec only (no test plan)** — generate a test plan from the spec: identify testable flows,
  write TC-prefixed cases with tiers/steps/expected results, present for approval, adjust per
  feedback.

#### Branch 4 — Nothing available (`test_plan_source: absent`)

**Condition:** no receipt, no permanent file, no inline test plan, no spec source, no
`swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md` (bug-fix path).

Proceed to Step 1.5. Do not run any checks.

---

## Step 1.5: Source-Missing Gate

### Proposal table

| Situation | Proposal |
|---|---|
| No spec, no test plan, implement receipt exists (feature) | Run `/write-spec` (requirements doc) or `/generate-test-plan` (tests only), then re-run acceptance. |
| Spec exists without acceptance criteria, no test plan, UI project | Run `/generate-test-plan` to produce executable TCs, or add acceptance criteria to the spec. |
| Bugfix path with no `swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md` | Run `/debug` to capture reproduction steps, then re-run acceptance. |
| Only `design.figma` in spec, no test plan, UI project | Design-only review possible via ux-expert; for functional acceptance also run `/generate-test-plan`. |

### Options

1. **Create the missing source** — invoke the proposed upstream skill, then re-run acceptance.
2. **Abort acceptance** — exit without a receipt; user re-invokes when ready.

Exploratory QA without a scenario is the `bug-hunt` skill's responsibility. Do not offer it as
a fallback inside acceptance.

From `feature-flow` / `bugfix-flow` this gate rarely fires — upstream skills guarantee a
source. Standalone invocations are the main user.

---

## Step 2: Persist E2E Scenario

**Only relevant if `has_ui_surface == true` and a scenario source exists** (test plan, spec
with AC, or debug.md). Re-anchoring against this file is enforced by `manual-tester` —
acceptance writes it once here; re-reads during aggregation only.

The running-app environment (device, simulator, emulator, browser) is **owned by
`manual-tester` itself** — see its Step 0 Environment Setup. This skill does not probe
devices, run `gradlew installDebug`, or start dev servers; it delegates that responsibility
wholesale to the agent.

Save to `swarm-report/<slug>-e2e-scenario.md`:

```markdown
# E2E Scenario: <task name>
Type: Feature / Bug fix
Project type: <project_type>
Spec source: <what was used>

## Steps
- [ ] 1. <concrete user action> → Expected: <result>
- [ ] 2. <concrete user action> → Expected: <result>
```

For bug fixes, steps come from `debug.md` reproduction steps inverted:
- Original: "Step X triggers the bug" → E2E: "Step X no longer triggers the bug".

Compaction-resilience (enforced by `manual-tester`, not by this skill): checkbox marks survive
compaction; completed steps (`[x]`) are not repeated; resume from the first incomplete step.

---

## Step 2.5: Dedup Probe

Read `swarm-report/<slug>-quality.md` (produced by `implement`'s Quality Loop). Three cases:

- **`Status: PASS`, receipt is from the current branch head** — `code-reviewer` is skipped.
  Freshness is inferred from the receipt's `Date:` field vs the branch commit window; if it
  cannot be confirmed (e.g. receipt significantly older than the latest commit), do **not**
  skip — run `code-reviewer` normally. On skip, write a stub artifact at
  `swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-code.md` with `verdict: SKIPPED`, `blocked_on: null`, and a
  one-line body referencing `<slug>-quality.md`.
- **`Status: FAIL`** — Quality Loop failed upstream; do not silently proceed. Run
  `code-reviewer` anyway, and surface `blocked_on: quality-loop failed — see <slug>-quality.md`
  in the Step 4 Summary. The aggregated Status is forced to `PARTIAL` at minimum (or
  `FAILED` if `code-reviewer` itself returns `FAIL`).
- **Receipt missing** — run `code-reviewer` normally. No skip.

Field name matches `implement`'s receipt schema. Note: `code-reviewer` skipping here is
decoupled from the Re-verification Loop's `diff_hash` policy — the dedup here is about
"implement already ran code-review on this diff", whereas `diff_hash` idempotency (§Re-verification
Loop) is about "previous acceptance run covered this same diff".

This probe is synchronous — it decides the Step 3 fan-out composition and emits the stub
before fan-out.

---

## Step 2.6: Persist Fan-out State

Before issuing the Step 3 fan-out — but **after** the full check plan has been finalized
(Step 3 intro resolves base + all conditional triggers) — save the plan and
compaction-resilient progress to `swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-state.md`. Symmetric to
`multiexpert-review`'s state file. This file carries the acceptance run across context compaction —
it is never a receipt, just operational state.

Step ordering: 2.5 dedup probe → Step 3 intro resolves conditional triggers → write the
state file here (Step 2.6) with the complete `Planned Checks` list → Step 3 body dispatches
the fan-out.

```markdown
# Acceptance State: <slug>

Status: planning | running | aggregating | done
Cycle: <N> of 3              # incremented on Re-verification Loop re-entry
Started: <ISO8601>
Base: <base-branch>
Diff hash: <sha256 of git diff <base>...HEAD>
Spec hash: <sha256 of spec file, or null>
Test-plan hash: <sha256 of permanent test plan, or null>

## Planned Checks
- [ ] manual (triggered by has_ui_surface + scenario)
- [ ] code (triggered by dedup miss)
- [ ] ac-coverage (triggered by spec.acceptance_criteria_ids)
- [ ] security (triggered by spec.risk_areas: [auth])
- ...

## Completed Checks
- [x] code — swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-code.md — PASS
- [x] build — swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-build.md — PASS
...

## Aggregated Verdict History
### Cycle 1
Verdict: FAILED
Blockers: <copy from aggregated receipt>
```

**Rules:**
1. Create and populate the file only after the full check plan is finalized — base
   fan-out plus all conditional triggers (spec-driven and diff-driven) — and before any
   agent batch is spawned. The initial `Planned Checks` list must reflect that complete
   plan.
2. Before each major action (spawning an agent batch, aggregating, writing the final
   receipt) — **re-read** the state file via Read tool. Completed checks (`[x]`) are not
   re-spawned on resume after compaction.
3. Mark each check `[x]` with the artifact path and verdict as soon as the per-check file
   is written.
4. On Re-verification Loop re-entry (§Re-verification Loop), increment `Cycle`, reset the
   `Planned Checks` list using the new diff/spec/test-plan hashes, move checks to be skipped
   to a **`## Re-used from previous cycle`** section (with artifact pointers), and append a
   new entry under `Aggregated Verdict History` when the cycle completes.
5. When `Status: done` is written, the state file becomes read-only operational history —
   it is not deleted automatically.

The state file and the e2e-scenario file (`<slug>-e2e-scenario.md`) are independent — the
latter is `manual-tester`'s internal re-anchor, owned by the agent; the state file is
acceptance's own fan-out cursor, owned by this skill.

---

## Step 3: Run Checks (parallel fan-out)

Pick the check plan by `has_ui_surface` plus conditional triggers read from spec frontmatter.
Emit **one** message containing all tool calls simultaneously (Agent calls + Bash smoke). Do
not wait for any to return before dispatching the others.

### Base check plan

| `has_ui_surface` | Base fan-out |
|---|---|
| `true` | `manual-tester` + `code-reviewer` (unless skipped by Step 2.5) |
| `false` | `code-reviewer` (unless skipped by Step 2.5) + build smoke (Bash) |

### Conditional triggers

Add to the fan-out only when the trigger fires. Each trigger maps to a specialist agent with a
narrow prompt. When no trigger fires for an agent, the agent is not spawned. Triggers read
either from spec frontmatter or directly from the diff.

| Trigger | Agent | Role |
|---|---|---|
| spec `acceptance_criteria_ids` non-empty | `business-analyst` | AC coverage — every `AC-N` has evidence in the diff, TC list, or manual-tester report |
| spec `design.figma` set, `has_ui_surface == true` | `ux-expert` design-review | Verify UI matches the referenced mockup + project design system |
| spec `non_functional.a11y` set, `has_ui_surface == true` | `ux-expert` a11y focus | Accessibility audit against the declared WCAG level |
| spec `risk_areas` includes any of `auth`, `payment`, `pii`, `data-migration` | `security-expert` | Security review against diff and any persisted state changes |
| spec `non_functional.sla` set, **or** `risk_areas` includes `perf-critical` | `performance-expert` | Bench/regress check against the declared SLA |
| diff touches a public API symbol, **or** changes span ≥ 3 top-level modules | `architecture-expert` | Module boundaries, dependency direction, public API contract |
| diff touches any build file (`build.gradle*`, `settings.gradle*`, `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`) | `build-engineer` | Build config sanity — plugin versions, task wiring, dependency additions |
| diff touches CI / release config (`.github/workflows/*`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, `.circleci/config.yml`, `release.yml`) | `devops-expert` | Pipeline/release health, secret handling, rollout gates |

**Diff-based trigger detection.** Two cached passes over the same diff:

1. **Path pass** — run `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` once and cache the path set.
   Use the cached set for all path-only rules (build files, CI/release config, cross-module
   span).
2. **Content pass (on demand)** — when the `architecture-expert` rule needs to decide
   "diff touches a public API symbol", read the diff body once via
   `git diff --unified=0 <base>...HEAD -- <cached-paths>` and cache it for the whole run.
   Evaluate public-API heuristics against those patch hunks.

Both caches live for the duration of the acceptance run — do not re-probe per agent.

**Public API detection heuristic** for `architecture-expert`:
- **Kotlin/Java**: changes under `src/main/` that add/remove/rename a `public` / `open`
  symbol, or touch module-level files (`settings.gradle*`, `Module.kt`, `Dependencies.kt`).
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: changes to `export` / re-export lines, `index.ts` public
  entrypoints, or `package.json` `"exports"` field.
- **Swift**: changes to `public` / `open` declarations or `Package.swift`
  `products` / `targets`.
- **HTTP/RPC surface**: changes to files matching `**/routes/**`, `**/controllers/**`,
  `**/handlers/**`, `**/api/**`, `*.proto`, `*.graphql`, `openapi.yaml`.
- **Cross-module threshold**: `git diff --name-only` spans ≥ 3 top-level module directories
  discovered from `settings.gradle*` / `package.json` workspaces / `Cargo.toml`
  `[workspace]` members.

If the heuristic is ambiguous, default to **not** spawning `architecture-expert` — a false
negative is safer than a false positive (the skill exists to catch high-risk changes, not
every diff).

When both design-review and a11y triggers fire, combine into one `ux-expert` invocation with
mode `both`. When no trigger fires, acceptance runs the base plan only — preserving
backward compatibility with specs written before iteration 2.

**Future iterations** will add `visual-check` as a separate sibling skill (not a fan-out
member) for pixel-level regression.

### Per-check artifact schema (shared by all sub-checks)

Each sub-check writes `swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-<check>.md` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: acceptance-check
check: manual | code | build | ac-coverage | design | a11y | security | performance | architecture | build-config | devops
agent: <agent-name or "bash">
verdict: PASS | WARN | FAIL | SKIPPED
severity: critical | major | minor | null
confidence: high | medium | low | null
domain_relevance: high | medium | low | null
diff_hash: <sha256 of `git diff <base>...HEAD` at the moment the check ran; null for checks that do not depend on the diff>
blocked_on: <optional — what the user must resolve; also used when a planned per-check artifact is missing>
---
```

**`diff_hash` semantics.** Computed once per acceptance run from
`git diff <base>...HEAD | sha256sum`; every check written during that run records the same
value. The Re-verification Loop uses it to decide which checks to re-run (see §Re-verification
Loop). Bash-only checks (build smoke) record the same hash because their input is the same
diff. Checks whose verdict does not depend on the diff at all (e.g. a spec-only sanity check
with no code to review) may write `diff_hash: null` — the Re-verification Loop never skips
such a check purely on hash match.

File naming is **one file per `check` value**: `swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance-<check>.md`
(e.g. `-manual.md`, `-code.md`, `-design.md`, `-a11y.md`). When a single agent invocation
covers multiple concerns (see `ux-expert` below), it writes separate files per concern to
keep the one-file-per-check invariant intact.

`severity`, `confidence`, `domain_relevance` are required when `verdict` is `WARN` or `FAIL`;
null for `PASS` / `SKIPPED`. These drive the PoLL aggregation in Step 4.

### 3.1–3.10 Per-agent sub-check prompts

Each sub-check (manual-tester, code-reviewer, build smoke, business-analyst, ux-expert in
design-review / a11y / both modes, security-expert, performance-expert, architecture-expert,
build-engineer, devops-expert) has a narrow prompt template and verdict rules — covering
inputs, output path, and PASS/WARN/FAIL criteria. Spawn each via Agent tool in the same
fan-out message; build smoke runs via Bash.

See `references/subcheck-prompts.md` for the full prompt template and verdict rules per
agent and for the build-smoke command table.

---

## Step 4: Aggregate and Write Receipt

Read each per-check artifact's frontmatter first (body only if `verdict != PASS`), then
reduce via PoLL rules (same protocol as `multiexpert-review` §"Step 4 — Synthesize verdict").
Bug severities (P0–P3) remain the primary routing axis; PoLL layers additional rules for
cases not covered by bug severity alone. Derive Aggregated Status (`VERIFIED | FAILED |
PARTIAL`), write the aggregated receipt to `swarm-report/<slug>-acceptance.md` (including
idempotency hashes, Check Plan, Check Results table, Convergence signals, Summary, Bugs
Found, Recommendation), and route to the invoking orchestrator.

Missing-artifact invariant: if a planned per-check artifact is missing at aggregation time,
treat the check as `verdict: FAIL` with `blocked_on: per-check artifact missing` — do not
silently drop it.

See `references/aggregation.md` for the PoLL rule table, Aggregated Status table, full
receipt format, and the orchestrator routing table.

---

## Re-verification Loop

On fix-loop re-entry (after `FAILED` → `implement` fix → re-run acceptance), re-probe Step 0
and Step 1, compute `diff_hash_new`, then decide per-check action from the decision table
(PASS/SKIPPED/WARN with matching `diff_hash` → skip; any FAIL → always re-run; missing or
`null` prior hash → re-run). `business-analyst` and `manual-tester` get a spec/test-plan
change override: if `spec_hash` or `test_plan_hash` changed — or is missing from an older
receipt — re-run them regardless of `diff_hash`. Overwrite per-check artifacts with a fresh
`diff_hash`, aggregate into a fresh receipt, and repeat until VERIFIED or the user ships
as-is.

See `references/re-verification.md` for the full per-check decision table, the
spec/test-plan change override rule, the back-compat rule for older receipts, and the
per-agent re-run scope details.
