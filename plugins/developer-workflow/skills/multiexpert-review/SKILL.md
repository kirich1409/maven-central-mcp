name: multiexpert-review
description: >-
  Review documentation artifacts (plan, spec, test-plan) with a panel of independent expert
  agents before commit. Use when asked to review a plan, spec, test-plan, or similar
  documentation artifact. Uses the PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators) consensus protocol.
  Invoke on phrases: "review the plan", "review the spec", "check the plan", "validate the
  approach", "multi-expert review", "panel review", "план ревью", "проверь план", "оцени план",
  "check the spec", or after exiting Plan Mode and wanting independent expert evaluation before
  implementation. Also invoke when the user says "is this plan good?", "what did I miss?",
  "sanity check this", "review this before I start", "check my approach", or wants multiple
  viewpoints on an implementation strategy. Do NOT invoke for code review (use code-reviewer
  agent instead) or PR review.

# Multi-Expert Review

Engine for multi-agent independent review of a documentation artifact (plan, spec, test-plan, etc.) followed by consensus synthesis. Artifact-specific semantics live in **profiles** at `profiles/<name>.md`. The engine here is artifact-agnostic — it discovers and routes, but never encodes one artifact type's rubric in its own body.

## Why This Exists

A single reviewer has blind spots. Different experts catch different problems — an architect spots coupling issues, a security engineer finds auth gaps, a performance expert flags N+1 queries. Independent parallel review prevents groupthink: each agent forms their own opinion before seeing anyone else's, which surfaces more diverse issues than sequential discussion.

The core value is not that individual reviews are better — it's that **multiple independent perspectives surface issues that any single reviewer would miss**, and the structured synthesis makes disagreements and consensus explicit rather than hidden.

## Protocol: PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators)

The review follows the Panel of LLM Evaluators protocol:

1. **Independent parallel review** — each agent reviews the artifact from their expertise, unaware of other reviewers
2. **Structured output** — every agent returns issues with severity and confidence scores
3. **Confidence-weighted synthesis** — the orchestrator aggregates results, weighting by domain relevance
4. **Explicit uncertainty** — disagreements between agents surface as "requires decision", not silently resolved

## Engine invariants (not overridable by profiles)

Profiles MUST NOT declare these — they are engine constants:

- **Review output structure** — Summary / Domain Relevance / Issues with severity+confidence+issue+suggestion (fixed in Step 3 prompt)
- **Aggregation rules** — convergence → escalate, contradictions → surface, confidence-weighting (fixed in Step 4)
- **State machine transitions** — fixed in this file
- **Revise-loop cap** — max 3 cycles (engine constant)
- **Review prompt template skeleton** — profiles add via `## Prompt augmentation`, never replace

See `profiles/README.md` for the negative-list of forbidden frontmatter fields and the `FORBIDDEN_PROFILE_FIELD` error behavior.

## Workflow

```
┌─ Read artifact, detect profile, load it
│       ↓
│  Discover agents, pre-select per profile.reviewer_roster
│       ↓
│  Spawn selected agents in parallel (independent review)
│       ↓
│  Collect all reviews
│       ↓
│  Synthesize verdict (engine aggregation, profile-supplied verdict alphabet)
│       ↓
│  Present verdict + update receipt (if profile has one)
│       ↓
│  ┌─ PASS → Done (proceed to implementation)
│  ├─ CONDITIONAL / WARN → see profile verdict policy
│  └─ FAIL → Fix artifact at source → Re-review ─┐
│                                                │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              (max 3 review cycles)
```

### Allowed transitions

```
Read+Detect  → Select Agents
Select       → Parallel Review
Review       → Synthesize
Synthesize   → Verdict
Verdict:PASS → Done
Verdict:COND → Fix Artifact   (profiles whose alphabet includes CONDITIONAL)
Verdict:WARN → Done           (profiles whose alphabet includes WARN)
Verdict:FAIL → Fix Artifact
Fix Artifact → Re-review (back to Parallel Review with same agents + locked profile)
Re-review    → Synthesize → Verdict (same cycle)
```

**Forbidden:** skipping Read+Detect → Review, or re-running detection in cycle ≥2 (profile is locked at cycle 1).

**Cycle cap:** 3 total (initial + 2 re-reviews). Still FAIL after cycle 3 → escalate to user.

## Persistence (compaction resilience)

Save state to `./swarm-report/multiexpert-review-<slug>-state.md` (or `multiexpert-review-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-state.md` if no slug known).

**Slug source** (in priority order):
1. Explicit caller args (`slug:` field)
2. Artifact frontmatter `slug:` field
3. Artifact filename without extension
4. Timestamp fallback

**Legacy read:** if the slug-qualified file doesn't exist, try `./swarm-report/plan-review-state.md` (legacy from pre-rename era). If found, copy content into the new slug-qualified name and continue on the new file. Do not delete the legacy file — user decides.

**Always write:** new slug-qualified name.

State file structure:

```markdown
# Multi-Expert Review State
Source: {plan_mode | file:<path> | conversation}
Profile: {implementation-plan | test-plan | spec | ...}   # locked at cycle 1
Profile source: {caller_hint | frontmatter | path | signature | user_prompt}
Cycle: {1 | 2 | 3} of 3
Status: {detecting | reviewing | synthesizing | fixing | done}

## Artifact Summary
{goal, technologies, scope — extracted in Step 1}

## Selected Agents
- {agent1} (recommended)
- {agent2} (recommended)

## Reviews Completed
- [x] {agent1} — {severity counts: N critical, M major, K minor}
- [ ] {agent2} — pending

## Verdict History
### Cycle 1: {PASS | CONDITIONAL | FAIL | WARN}
- Blockers: {list}
- Improvements: {list}

### Cycle 2: ...
```

Update after each significant step. Re-read before each action — skip completed steps.

## Step 1 — Read artifact and detect profile

Locate the artifact. Check sources in order:

1. **Active Plan Mode output** — artifact is in conversation context
2. **File reference** — user points to a `.md` file; read it
3. **Conversation context** — user described it inline; extract
4. **Ask** — if none of the above

Track the source (Plan Mode / file / conversation) — Step 5 needs this.

### Detect profile

Follow the precedence chain defined in `profiles/README.md` §Detection precedence (canonical source). Engine enforces error semantics from that section — `UNKNOWN_PROFILE_HINT` on unknown caller hint, never silent fallback to a default profile.

Cycle-locking, profile validation (negative-list), and inventory-mismatch checks — see `profiles/README.md`. Engine applies these on every invocation before Step 2.

## Step 2 — Discover and select agents

### Discovery

Find real agents via `Glob("**/agents/*.md")` + built-in subagents from system prompt. Read each agent's frontmatter to confirm. Never invent phantom agents.

**Short-name collision tie-break:** if the same agent short-name resolves to multiple files (e.g., two plugins define `security-expert`), prefer first match in this order: (1) same-plugin as the caller skill, (2) sibling `developer-workflow-*` plugin, (3) any other source. If still ambiguous, fail loud: `[multiexpert-review ERROR] NO_REVIEWERS_AVAILABLE: ambiguous short-name <name> resolves to <paths>`. In practice the `developer-workflow-*` family guarantees unique short-names — this guard only triggers on non-family plugin conflicts.

### Selection per profile

Use `profile.reviewer_roster`:

- **`primary`** — mandatory roster. For each agent: if installed, include; if missing, skip.
- **`optional_if`** — for each entry: if `when` regex matches artifact content AND agent is installed, include.
- **Empty primary + empty optional_if match** — fall back to **tech-match selection** (implementation-plan profile relies on this): scan artifact for technology keywords, score agents by technology match / problem-specific value / gap coverage, recommend 2–3.

### Single-reviewer guard

If exactly 1 agent ended up selected:
- If `profile.allow_single_reviewer: true` — proceed. Final verdict carries a `## Review Mode: single-perspective` marker in the output text (not in any receipt — receipt schemas are profile-declared and do not include `review_mode`).
- If `profile.allow_single_reviewer: false` — fail loud `[multiexpert-review ERROR] NO_REVIEWERS_AVAILABLE: profile <name> requires panel, only <agent> available`.

If 0 agents — same `NO_REVIEWERS_AVAILABLE` error regardless of flag.

### User confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`, recommended agents first with one-sentence reason. User may override.

**Explicit user override:** if the user's prompt named specific agents (e.g., "review with kotlin-engineer"), skip discovery confirmation and use those.

## Step 3 — Parallel independent review

Spawn each selected agent in a **single message** (parallel) via the `Agent` tool.

### Review prompt (engine skeleton)

```
You are reviewing a {artifact_type} as a {agent_role} expert.

## The Artifact
{full_artifact_text}

{PROFILE_PROMPT_AUGMENTATION}

## Your Task
Review this artifact from the perspective of your expertise. Be specific and actionable.

## Required Output Format

You MUST structure your response exactly as follows:

### Summary
2-3 sentence overall assessment from your perspective.

### Domain Relevance
State one of: high | medium | low — how much does this artifact touch your area of expertise.

### Issues
For each issue, use this exact structure:

**Issue N: {short title}**
- **severity**: critical | major | minor
- **confidence**: high | medium | low
- **issue**: what the problem is (1-2 sentences)
- **suggestion**: what to do instead (1-2 sentences)

Severity guide:
- critical = blocks implementation or will cause serious failures
- major = significantly affects quality, performance, or maintainability
- minor = nice to have, low risk if skipped

Confidence guide:
- high = this is squarely in your domain and you're certain
- medium = relevant to your domain but you could be wrong
- low = outside your core expertise but worth flagging

Respond in the same language the artifact is written in.
```

`{PROFILE_PROMPT_AUGMENTATION}` is substituted from the profile's `## Prompt augmentation` section (empty for profiles that don't define one).

### Invariant rules

- **Never share one agent's review with another** — independence is the whole point
- **All agents get the same artifact text** — no summaries or interpretations
- **Prompt skeleton is engine-fixed** — profiles only add via augmentation section, never replace

## Step 4 — Synthesize verdict

Read all reviews. The engine aggregation rules (non-overridable):

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Critical severity with high confidence | Blocker |
| Same issue from 2+ agents independently | Escalate to critical regardless of individual severity |
| Major severity with high domain_relevance | Important improvement |
| Contradicting opinions between agents | Surface as "Uncertainty — requires decision"; do NOT silently pick one |
| Minor severity OR low confidence (single agent) | Suggestion |
| Low domain_relevance agent flagging an issue | Note but weight lower |

Profile contributes:

- **`verdicts`** — alphabet (e.g., `[PASS, CONDITIONAL, FAIL]` or `[PASS, WARN, FAIL]`)
- **`severity_mapping`** — for checklist-based profiles (e.g., test-plan items a-e)

### Verdict format

```
## Multi-Expert Review Verdict: {PASS | CONDITIONAL | WARN | FAIL}

### Blockers (must fix)
- {issue} — raised by {agent(s)}, severity: critical
  Suggestion: {what to do}

### Important Improvements (strongly recommended)
- {issue} — raised by {agent(s)}, confidence: {level}

### Suggestions (nice to have)
- {issue}

### Uncertainties (requires your decision)
- {topic} — {Agent A} says X, {Agent B} says Y

### Consensus
{what all agents agreed on}

## Review Mode: single-perspective       # only when single-reviewer path was taken
```

**Single-agent case:** skip cross-referencing (no convergence / uncertainty sections). Present issues directly; add the `## Review Mode: single-perspective` marker.

### Verdict criteria

- **PASS** — no blockers, no important improvements, only minor suggestions
- **CONDITIONAL** (only in alphabets containing it) — no blockers, but important improvements would significantly affect quality
- **WARN** (only in alphabets containing it) — blockers satisfied but secondary items (e.g., test-plan (d)/(e)) violated; pipeline continues
- **FAIL** — has blockers

## Step 5 — Post-review action

### Fix routing

Per `profile.source_routing`:

| Source | Action (default) |
|--------|------------------|
| **Plan Mode** | `EnterPlanMode` with issues list |
| **File** | Edit the file directly (add `## Issues to Resolve` or restructure inline) |
| **Conversation** | Present issues and work through inline with user |

Profiles may override or mark actions as `N/A` for sources they don't support.

### Receipt integration

If `profile.receipt` is present:
- Resolve `receipt.path_template` by substituting `<slug>`
- For each field in `receipt.fields_to_update`, write the corresponding value derived from the verdict (e.g., `review_verdict: WARN`, `review_warnings: [...]`, `review_blockers: [...]`)
- If profile path is `swarm-report/...` — create if missing (respecting generate-test-plan's receipt contract)

If `profile.receipt` is absent — skip receipt writing.

### Verdict handling

- **PASS** — confirm artifact is ready; done.
- **CONDITIONAL** — present improvements; ask user; fix per `source_routing` if confirmed.
- **WARN** — pipeline continues; engine records warnings in receipt; no revise-loop.
- **FAIL** — fix per `source_routing` without asking; auto re-run review on same agents + same profile; update state file with cycle N and new verdict. After cycle 3 still FAIL → escalate to user.

## Error semantics

All engine errors produce exactly this prefix on the first line of output:

```
[multiexpert-review ERROR] <CATEGORY>: <details>
```

Categories:

- `UNKNOWN_PROFILE_HINT` — caller hint not in inventory
- `FORBIDDEN_PROFILE_FIELD` — profile frontmatter contains forbidden field
- `NO_REVIEWERS_AVAILABLE` — no agents remain after discovery/filtering, or panel required but single
- `PROFILE_INVENTORY_MISMATCH` — README list vs. `profiles/*.md` presence disagree

Consumers (`feature-flow`, `write-spec`, etc.) detect this prefix to distinguish engine errors from ordinary review FAIL verdicts.
