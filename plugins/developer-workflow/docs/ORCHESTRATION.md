# Dev Workflow Orchestration

Rules for routing developer tasks through the correct pipeline and managing stage transitions. Applies to all projects that use the `developer-workflow` plugin.

## Task Profiling

When receiving a task, classify it by **size and complexity**, then pick the appropriate pipeline:

| Size | Criteria | Pipeline |
|------|----------|----------|
| Small | 1-3 files, clear change, no new APIs | Implement → done (mechanical + intent only; finalize/acceptance skipped for truly trivial changes) |
| Medium | Multiple files, one module, known patterns | Plan → Implement → Finalize → Acceptance → PR |
| Large | Cross-module, new APIs, unfamiliar libraries | Research → Plan → Implement → Finalize → Acceptance → PR |
| Migration | Library/technology swap | Research → Snapshot → Migrate → Finalize → Acceptance → PR |
| Research | Investigation only, no code changes | Research → Report |

**Skip stages that add no value for the task at hand.** A one-line bug fix does not need Research or a formal Plan. A large feature with unfamiliar dependencies needs the full pipeline.

Auto-detect from scope and context. If ambiguous — state the assumed profile and ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

Migration tasks use the `code-migration` skill.

## Research Consortium

On the Research stage, launch parallel experts (up to 5 agents simultaneously):

| Agent | Responsibility | Tool |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Explore | Codebase analysis: existing code, patterns, dependencies, call sites | ast-index, Read, Grep |
| Web search | Approaches, best practices, recent changes | Perplexity (`perplexity_search`, `perplexity_research`) or WebSearch |
| Docs | Library documentation for involved dependencies | DeepWiki / Context7 |
| Deps | Compatibility, versions, vulnerabilities | maven-mcp tools |
| Architecture | How the change fits into the project structure | `architecture-expert` agent |

Not every task needs all five. Launch only what the task demands — a simple bug fix may need only Explore + Docs; a large feature or migration needs the full consortium.

After results arrive, launch `business-analyst` agent to review the combined findings: check completeness, flag gaps, surface conflicting data.

Artifact: `swarm-report/<slug>-research.md`

## Web Lookup

Use web sources when the task involves external libraries, migrations, or unfamiliar APIs. Skip for internal-only changes where codebase analysis is sufficient.

- Perplexity — approaches, best practices, common pitfalls
- DeepWiki / Context7 — library docs and API reference
- WebSearch — recent releases, breaking changes, migration guides
- maven-mcp — dependency compatibility and vulnerability data

## Re-Anchoring

Before each pipeline stage, the executing agent must re-read:

1. The original user intent / task description
2. The research report (`swarm-report/<slug>-research.md`) — if exists
3. The plan (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md` or Plan Mode output) — if exists

Include these paths in the agent's context handoff prompt. This prevents drift from the original goal during long sessions and across agent boundaries.

## State Machine

Allowed transitions between stages. Forward is default; backward transitions are explicit recovery paths.

```
Research ──→ Plan
Plan ──→ TestPlan           (test-plan stage not skipped)
Plan ──→ Implement          (test-plan stage skipped: skip-detector conditions or --skip-test-plan)
Plan ──→ Research           (multiexpert review reveals gaps or missing context)
TestPlan ──→ TestPlanReview
TestPlanReview ──→ Implement  (PASS or WARN)
TestPlanReview ──→ TestPlan   (FAIL — revise loop, max 3 cycles, then escalate)
Implement ──→ Finalize
Implement ──→ Research      (scope is larger than expected — escalate)
Finalize ──→ Acceptance     (PASS — no BLOCK remains)
Finalize ──→ Implement      (ESCALATE after 3 rounds; user routes back to fix root issues)
Finalize ──→ Escalate       (ESCALATE after 3 rounds; user picks non-implement path — stop state, not a stage)
Acceptance ──→ PR           (VERIFIED)
Acceptance ──→ Implement    (FAILED — fix bugs, then Implement re-runs Finalize)
Acceptance ──→ Debug        (FAILED — unclear root cause)
Acceptance ──→ TestPlan     (new P0/P1 bugs require a `## Regression TC` section appended to the permanent test plan)
PR ──→ Merge
PR ──→ Implement            (review feedback requires code changes)
```

Backward transition requires a reason logged in the stage artifact. No silent rollbacks.

## Receipt-Based Gating

Each stage produces an artifact in `swarm-report/`. The next stage reads it before starting. No stage begins without the receipt from the previous one.

| Stage | Artifact |
|-------|----------|
| Research | `<slug>-research.md` |
| Plan | `<slug>-plan.md` |
| TestPlan | `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` (permanent, source of truth) + `<slug>-test-plan.md` (receipt: `status`, `permanent_path`, `source_spec`, `review_verdict`, `phase_coverage`). Created by `generate-test-plan` when invoked from the orchestrator with a slug; read by `multiexpert-review` (test-plan profile) and `acceptance`. |
| TestPlanReview | `<slug>-test-plan.md` receipt updated in place: `review_verdict` set to PASS / WARN / FAIL, `status` advances Draft → Ready on PASS/WARN. |
| Implement | `<slug>-implement.md` (summary of changes, files touched) + `<slug>-quality.md` (mechanical checks / intent check results, notes for finalize) |
| Finalize | `<slug>-finalize.md` (round-by-round phase A-D findings, unresolved BLOCKs, acknowledged risks, commits added during finalize) |
| Acceptance | `<slug>-acceptance.md` (verification result: VERIFIED/FAILED/PARTIAL, evidence, `test_plan_source: receipt / mounted / on-the-fly / absent` when the Acceptance stage consumed a test plan) |
| PR | `<slug>-pr.md` (PR URL, description, reviewers) |

If a stage artifact is missing — the previous stage did not complete. Do not skip ahead.

## Quality Pipeline

Three stages cover the full quality picture. Each stage answers a different question.

| Stage | Skill | Question | Gate type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical + intent | `implement` | Does it compile, lint, test, and match the plan? | Two-gate Quality Loop |
| Code quality | `finalize` | Is the code written well? | Multi-round review-and-fix loop |
| Functional correctness | `acceptance` | Does the feature solve the user's problem? | Manual or automated QA |

The orchestrator sequences them: **implement → finalize → acceptance → PR**. Each stage consumes the previous stage's artifact as a receipt.

---

## Implement — Quality Loop (2 gates)

When the user asks to "prepare for PR", "quality check the branch", "run the quality loop", or "make it PR-ready" — run these gates on the current branch.

### Build system detection

Use the highest-priority match when multiple build files are present:

| Priority | File present | Build | Lint | Test |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Makefile` (with targets) | `make build` | `make lint` | `make test` |
| 2 | `package.json` | `npm run build` | `npm run lint` | `npm test` |
| 3 | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build` | `cargo clippy` | `cargo test` |
| 4 | `build.gradle(.kts)` | `./gradlew build` | `./gradlew lint` | `./gradlew test` |
| 5 | `pom.xml` | `mvn package -q` | `mvn checkstyle:check` | `mvn test` |
| 6 | `go.mod` | `go build ./...` | `golangci-lint run` | `go test ./...` |
| 7 | `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | `pip install -e .` | `ruff check .` | `pytest` |

Monorepo: if all changed files are under a single subdirectory with its own build file, use that subdirectory's build system.

### Project type detection

Orthogonal to build-system detection: build system answers "how to build/test",
project type answers "what kind of product is this". Drives which acceptance checks are
meaningful (e.g., manual UI QA only on UI surfaces). Consumed by `acceptance`, and may be
consumed by `research`, `generate-test-plan`, `create-pr` as those skills evolve.

Cheap heuristic over the repository root plus a few well-known paths (e.g. `app/`, `android/`,
`ios/`) — no external tools required, no exhaustive tree walk:

Each row resolves to exactly one `ecosystem` value — downstream steps (e.g. acceptance build-smoke command selection) assume a single value. Split cases where the same `project_type` has multiple possible stacks into distinct rows.

| Signal found at repo root or a well-known subdirectory | `project_type` | `has_ui_surface` | `ecosystem` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AndroidManifest.xml` under `app/` / `android/`, or `build.gradle*` with `com.android.application` | `android` | true | `gradle` |
| `*.xcodeproj` / `*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift` iOS/macOS target, or `Podfile` iOS pods | `ios` | true | `xcode` |
| `package.json` with a frontend framework (`react`, `vue`, `svelte`, `next`, `vite`, `astro`) or root `index.html` | `web` | true | `node` |
| `package.json` with `electron` | `desktop` | true | `node` |
| Compose Desktop entrypoint (Gradle with `org.jetbrains.compose` applied to a JVM target) | `desktop` | true | `gradle` |
| Swift AppKit entrypoint (`NSApplication` main or `@main App` targeting macOS) | `desktop` | true | `xcode` |
| `build.gradle*` with Spring / Ktor / Micronaut / Quarkus / `application` plugin (not Android) | `backend-jvm` | false | `gradle` |
| `package.json` with a Node server (`express`, `fastify`, `koa`, `nest`) and no frontend framework | `backend-node` | false | `node` |
| `Cargo.toml` without web/GUI frameworks, or Rust `bin/` entrypoints | `cli` | false | `rust` |
| `pyproject.toml` without web/GUI frameworks, or Python `bin/` entrypoints | `cli` | false | `python` |
| `go.mod` without web/GUI frameworks, or Go `bin/` entrypoints | `cli` | false | `go` |
| `.claude-plugin/` directory (or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `library` | false | `node` |
| Gradle/Maven library packaging without application plugin | `library` | false | `gradle` |
| None of the above matches unambiguously | `generic` | ask user | ask user |

**Override policy.** When `write-spec` records `platform:` in the spec frontmatter or the user
explicitly corrects a detection, that value takes precedence over the heuristic and is recorded
as `project_type_override` in the consuming skill's receipt.

**Scope.** Root-level glance plus the listed subdirectories is enough. Do not recurse. If the
detection is ambiguous (`generic`), ask the user once — do not guess and do not fall back to a
default like `library`.

### Scope decision

- **In current changes** (`git diff $BASE...HEAD`) — fix autonomously
- **Out of scope, obvious fix** (missing import, typo in new string) — fix autonomously
- **Out of scope, non-obvious** (pre-existing failures, unrelated deps) — note for user, don't fix; include what the issue is, why it's unrelated, and options (fix / skip / separate issue)

**Minor (exit loop):** style preferences, cosmetic suggestions with no correctness impact.
**Non-minor (keep looping):** bugs, broken tests, lint errors, security issues, incorrect logic.

### Gates (sequential)

| # | Gate | Action | Agent |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Mechanical checks | Invoke `/check` — detects project tooling and runs build + lint + typecheck + tests with fail-fast; fix reported issues, re-invoke until PASS | Implementation agent + `/check` skill |
| 2 | Intent check | Re-read original task + plan, verify the diff addresses them; scope creep or drift → fix or flag | Orchestrator |

### Iteration cap

- **Per gate:** max 3 fix attempts. If still failing after 3 — stop and escalate to user with the failure details and what was tried.
- **Total quality loop:** max 3 full iterations (gate 1–2 cycles). If the loop does not converge — escalate.

### Quality report artifact

After the loop completes (pass or escalation), save `swarm-report/<slug>-quality.md` with:

- Gate results (mechanical checks, intent check)
- Issues found and fixes applied
- Notes for `finalize` — anything surfaced during implement that the finalize stage should investigate (test coverage gaps, security concerns, structural concerns that did not block mechanical checks)

This artifact is the receipt for the Finalize stage — Finalize must not start without it.

---

## Finalize — Code-quality loop

Between `implement` and `acceptance`, the orchestrator runs the `finalize` skill. See [`skills/finalize/SKILL.md`](../skills/finalize/SKILL.md) for full details. Summary of the contract:

### Phases per round (A → B → C → D)

| Phase | Agent / skill | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| A | `code-reviewer` (from `developer-workflow-experts`) | Semantic review: plan conformance, CLAUDE.md, bug detection. Confidence-scored 0/25/50/75/100. |
| B | `/simplify` (built-in) | Reuse / quality / efficiency pass with auto-fix (3 parallel review agents + direct fix) |
| C | `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`, `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`, `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` — parallel | Test quality, silent failures, type design invariants |
| D | `security-expert`, `performance-expert`, `architecture-expert` — conditional, parallel | Domain-specific deep review |

Between phases and after any auto-fix, the orchestrator invokes `/check` to confirm mechanical pass.

### Separation of author and reviewer (Phase A)

The agent that wrote the code must NOT perform the Phase A semantic review. Launch the `code-reviewer` agent with only:

1. The original task description (verbatim)
2. The plan artifact (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md`) — or `swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md` for bugfix-flow — if exists
3. The `git diff` of all changes

Nothing else. No implementation context. Questions the reviewer must answer:
- Does the code solve the original problem?
- Is there scope creep beyond the plan?
- Are acceptance criteria from the plan met?

Invocation template:
```
## Task description
{original task description verbatim}

## Plan or debug context
Read: {path to swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md or -debug.md, or "No context document"}

## Changes to review
Read the diff at: {path to swarm-report/<slug>-diff.txt}

Review these changes and produce a structured verdict.
```

### Phase D expert-review triggers

| Expert | Trigger — files touch any of: |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `security-expert` | Auth, encryption, token/secret storage, network requests, permissions, user data handling |
| `performance-expert` | RecyclerView/LazyColumn adapters, database queries, image loading, coroutine dispatchers, hot loops, large collections |
| `architecture-expert` | New modules created, dependency direction changed, public API modified, new abstractions introduced |

If no trigger matches — skip Phase D entirely.

### Exit criteria

- **PASS** — no BLOCK-severity findings remain. WARN and NIT surface in the report but do not block progression to acceptance.
- **ESCALATE** — after 3 rounds, BLOCK findings remain. Orchestrator stops and reports to the user.

### Finalize report artifact

Save `swarm-report/<slug>-finalize.md` with round-by-round findings (see `skills/finalize/SKILL.md` for the full schema). This artifact is the receipt for the Acceptance stage — Acceptance must not start without it.

## Testing Strategy in Planning

The Plan stage MUST include these sections:

- **Testing Strategy** — unit / integration / manual QA; which tools (`manual-tester`, device testing, etc.); what is covered by automated tests vs manual verification
- **Verification Approach** — how to verify on a live app or in a running environment; what commands to run; what to visually inspect
- **Acceptance Criteria** — derived from research, task description, or user requirements; concrete and verifiable conditions for "done"

A plan without these sections is incomplete. Use `multiexpert-review` skill to validate before proceeding to implementation.

## Skill and Agent Selection

Route implementation to the right specialist:

| Task type | Skill / Agent |
|-----------|--------------|
| Research / investigation | `research` skill |
| Feature decomposition | `decompose-feature` skill |
| Compose UI from design/spec | `compose-developer` agent |
| Kotlin business logic, data layer | `kotlin-engineer` agent |
| View → Compose migration | `migrate-to-compose` skill |
| Library / technology swap | `code-migration` skill |
| Module → KMP | `kmp-migration` skill |
| Full autonomous feature cycle | `feature-flow` skill |
| Full autonomous bug-fix cycle | `bugfix-flow` skill |
| Architectural variability | `design-options` skill (optional pre-plan-review stage) |
| Mechanical verification (build/lint/typecheck/tests) | `check` skill |
| Code-quality pass (review + /simplify + pr-review-toolkit + experts) | `finalize` skill |
| PR creation and lifecycle management | `create-pr` skill (`--draft` / `--refresh` / `--promote`) |
| Triage feedback (PR comments or pasted text) — categorize, prioritize, group; optionally post replies / resolve threads for items with terminal verdicts via an editable manifest; never edits code | `triage-feedback` skill |
| Plan review (PoLL) | `multiexpert-review` skill |
| Test plan creation | `generate-test-plan` skill |
| Feature verification on device | `acceptance` skill |
| Retroactive test writing | `write-tests` skill |
| Undirected QA / bug hunting | `bug-hunt` skill |
| Research findings review | `business-analyst` agent |

## Stage Boundary Protocol

At every stage boundary:

1. Write the stage artifact to `swarm-report/`
2. Include the artifact path in the next agent's prompt — the agent reads it itself
3. Validate the artifact before advancing: does it address the original task? Is it concrete (file paths, findings, code), not generic filler?
4. Run `/compact` only for Large/Migration tasks or when context is noticeably degraded. Skip for Small/Medium tasks.
