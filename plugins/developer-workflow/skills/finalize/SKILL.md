# Finalize

Code-quality pass over the current branch. Multi-round review-and-fix loop focused on **how** the code is written (quality, clarity, robustness), not **what** it does (functional acceptance) or **whether it works** (build/tests via `/check`).

This skill exists because agent-written code carries recurring patterns worth polishing: over-engineered abstractions, silent failures in catch blocks, weak test coverage, fragile type designs, redundant utilities. `/check` doesn't catch these; `code-reviewer` alone is too narrow; `/simplify` alone is too narrow. `finalize` orchestrates the whole pass.

---

## Three quality layers — where `finalize` fits

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| Does the code work and match the plan? | build/lint/tests via `/check`, plus the implementer's own intent check |
| **Is the code written well?** | **this skill (`finalize`)** |
| Does the feature solve the user's problem? | `acceptance` — functional verification via `manual-tester` |

**Author fixes broken tests (non-negotiable).** A `/check` invocation between phases that surfaces test failures triggers an inline fix in the same Finalize round — owned by the engineer agent that produced the change. Round-end exit is impossible while tests remain red. The single escape hatch is an explicit skip-marker with a justification and a recorded follow-up issue.

---

## Inputs

The caller (orchestrator or user) provides:
- **`slug`** — the task slug used for artifact naming
- **Branch state** — finalize reads the current branch; it does not switch branches
- **Context artifact path (optional)** — Phase A's `code-reviewer` anchor. Accepts either a feature plan (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md`) or, for bug fixes, the debug artifact (`swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md`). Either works — `code-reviewer` treats whichever is provided as the "what was supposed to happen" document.
- **Diff artifact path (derived)** — before invoking `code-reviewer`, materialize the diff to `swarm-report/<slug>-diff.txt` and pass that path to the agent. Do **not** hardcode `origin/main`: derive the remote's default branch first (the same way `create-pr` does — `git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch" | awk '{print $NF}'`, with `main` / `master` / `develop` as ordered fallbacks), then diff `$(git merge-base origin/<base> HEAD)..HEAD`. Works on any repository regardless of default-branch naming.
- **Tolerance flags (optional):**
  - `--allow-warn` — stop after 1 round even if WARN findings remain (default: still exit PASS on WARN-only, but keep iterating BLOCKs until resolved or round budget runs out)
  - `--skip-experts` — omit Phase D (rarely useful; experts auto-skip if no triggers match)
  - `--max-rounds N` — override the default 3-round cap. Use when the user wants one more round after an ESCALATE, without restarting the whole stage. Must be ≥ 1.
  - `--coverage-audit` — force-on the Phase D `test-coverage-expert` trigger even when none of the diff conditions match. Useful for explicit pre-release coverage sweeps.
  - `--skip-coverage-audit` — turn off the Phase D `test-coverage-expert` trigger for this round. Discouraged; recorded verbatim with the user reason in the finalize report's `acknowledged risks` section.
  - `--skip-security-review "<reason>"` — turn off both the `risk_areas`-based and the pattern-based `security-expert` triggers for this round. The reason is a one-line free-text argument captured verbatim in the finalize report's `acknowledged risks` section (no separate prompt). Discouraged; other Phase D experts still fire on their own triggers.

---

## Round structure

Each round runs four phases A → B → C → D sequentially. Between phases and after any auto-fix, invoke `/check` to confirm the build still works. Accumulate findings. At the end of the round, decide: exit, or continue to next round.

```
Round N:
  Phase A  → code-reviewer          → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Phase B  → /simplify (auto-fixes) → /check               → continue
  Phase C  → pr-review-toolkit trio (parallel, if installed) → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Phase D  → expert reviews (conditional, parallel) → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Round end: did any BLOCK remain unfixed?
    yes → go to round N+1 (up to max_rounds total — default 3, see §Max round budget)
    no  → exit with PASS
```

### Exit criteria

- **PASS (exit):** no BLOCK severity findings from any phase. WARN and NIT findings listed in the report but do not block.
- **ESCALATE (stop and report to caller):** after `max_rounds` rounds (default 3, see §Max round budget), BLOCK findings still present. Dump unresolved findings, caller decides whether to override or return to implementation.

### Max round budget

Default `max_rounds = 3`, overridable to any integer ≥ 1 via the `--max-rounds N` flag (see §Inputs). The caller's flag wins when present; otherwise the default applies. ESCALATE semantics key off the effective value.

Total budget (per round: 4 phases + fixes + `/check` after each fix) can take non-trivial wall time on large diffs. If a project regularly hits the cap, the BLOCK threshold may be too strict for the project's conventions — tune Phase A's `code-reviewer` confidence threshold (see `developer-workflow-experts/agents/code-reviewer.md`) rather than silently raising `max_rounds`.

---

## Phase A — Semantic review (code-reviewer)

Launch the `code-reviewer` agent (from `developer-workflow-experts`) with:
- Original task description (verbatim)
- Plan artifact path (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md`) if it exists
- `git diff` of all branch changes

The agent returns a structured verdict: PASS / WARN / FAIL with findings scored on the 0/25/50/75/100 confidence rubric. Only findings passing the reporting threshold surface.

### Handling findings

Non-negotiables violations (flagged by `code-reviewer` from the `## Non-negotiables` sections in applicable `CLAUDE.md` files) are always BLOCK regardless of any confidence threshold — they cannot be moved to "acknowledged risks".

| Severity × confidence | Action |
|---|---|
| critical ≥ 75 | Fix immediately. After fix, re-run `/check`. If `/check` PASSes and the finding is resolved → BLOCK cleared. If the fix does not converge, the finding stays BLOCK — the round ends without exiting PASS; counted against the 3-round budget. Do not silently downgrade a critical finding to "acknowledged risk". |
| major ≥ 75 | Fix if tractable. On successful fix + `/check` PASS → BLOCK cleared. If fix requires refactoring beyond the diff scope → escalate to caller; the finding remains BLOCK until the caller resolves it or explicitly moves it to "acknowledged risks" at ESCALATE. |
| minor ≥ 50 | Include in report as NIT. Don't fix automatically; caller/user decides. NIT never blocks PASS. |

If `code-reviewer` returns FAIL verdict → this phase has BLOCKs that must be addressed before continuing.

### Output

Summary of this phase's findings goes into the round's log.

---

## Phase B — Built-in simplification (`/simplify`)

Invoke the built-in Claude Code skill `/simplify`. It performs a parallel reuse / quality / efficiency pass and **applies fixes directly** for the findings it considers real. The exact implementation (number of sub-agents, internal structure) may evolve — finalize treats `/simplify` as a behavioural contract, not an implementation detail.

`/simplify` focuses on:
- **Reuse**: duplicated logic that should use an existing utility
- **Quality**: redundant state, parameter sprawl, copy-paste, leaky abstractions, stringly-typed code, unnecessary comments
- **Efficiency**: redundant work, missed concurrency, hot-path bloat, TOCTOU, memory leaks

Because `/simplify` is fix-oriented, do not pre-review its output — trust the built-in, then run `/check` to confirm the project still builds and tests pass.

### If `/check` fails after `/simplify`

Revert the simplify commits (or the last commit if unambiguously from `/simplify`), log the failure with `phase: B, reason: revert`, continue to Phase C. Do not re-invoke `/simplify` in the same round — if it broke something once, it's likely to repeat.

**Round-budget semantic.** Phase B is a transformative step, not a finding-generator. A Phase B revert does NOT introduce an unresolved BLOCK and does NOT consume the round budget beyond the single Phase B attempt; the round continues normally through Phases C and D. This is distinct from `/check` failure after a Phase A/C/D fix (§Mechanical verification) — there the originating finding stays BLOCK and counts against the budget.

---

## Phase C — PR review toolkit (parallel, optional)

Phase C is a **soft-reference** to the `pr-review-toolkit` plugin (marketplace: `claude-plugins-official`). It is **not** declared as a hard dependency in `plugin.json` because that marketplace publishes its plugin entries without `version` fields, which makes semver resolution impossible for Claude Code.

### Detect-and-use

Before invoking Phase C, check whether the three agents are available (for example via the Task tool's agent registry). If any of the three is missing, **skip Phase C** for this round — log `phase: C, status: skipped, reason: pr-review-toolkit not installed` and continue to Phase D. Do not fail the round.

If all three are available, invoke them in **parallel**:

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer` | Quality of tests added in the diff: are edge cases covered? Behavioral vs. implementation testing? |
| `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` | Empty catch blocks, swallowed errors, catches too broad, errors logged but not surfaced |
| `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` | Can invalid states be represented? Are invariants encoded in types? Missing nullability markers, unsafe unions |

Each agent returns findings graded by the same 0–100 confidence rubric used by our `code-reviewer`; agents inherit the convention through prompt sharing.

### Handling Phase C findings

Apply fix-loop rules identical to Phase A:
- BLOCK (critical/major + confidence ≥ 75) → fix → `/check`
- WARN (minor ≥ 50) → report, don't auto-fix
- Below threshold → drop

Fixes for test-quality findings (e.g., "this test doesn't cover the failure path") may require writing new test code — delegate that to the appropriate engineer agent (`kotlin-engineer`, `swift-engineer`, etc.) with the finding as input.

---

## Phase D — Expert reviews (conditional, parallel)

Trigger experts only when the diff matches their domain. Launch the matching ones in **parallel**.

| Expert | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `architecture-expert` | new module, new public API surface, cross-module dependency change, or layered structure violation in diff |
| `security-expert` | spec/plan declared `risk_areas` ∈ {auth, payment, pii, data-migration}, or any pattern in the [Security-expert pattern triggers](#security-expert-pattern-triggers) table below |
| `performance-expert` | hot-path code (rendering, query loops, batch jobs), N+1 patterns, large-buffer allocations, threading/concurrency changes |
| `ux-expert` | UI-surface changes (composables, views, screens), copy / a11y / animation diffs |
| `build-engineer` | Gradle / Bazel / npm / Cargo / Xcode build script changes, plugin upgrades, version-catalog edits |
| `devops-expert` | CI / CD config, GitHub Actions / GitLab pipelines, deploy scripts, Dockerfile, infra-as-code |
| `business-analyst` | spec / requirements / scope changes (rare in finalize — usually fires upstream) |
| `test-coverage-expert` | see [`test-coverage-expert` (conditional)](#test-coverage-expert-conditional) below |

No trigger matched → skip Phase D entirely for this round.

### `security-expert` pattern triggers

The default `risk_areas`-based trigger only fires when the spec or plan explicitly declared `auth` / `payment` / `pii` / `data-migration`. Bug fixes, trivial features, and any task that arrives without a spec slip through. To close that gap, Phase D additionally fires `security-expert` when the diff matches the patterns below.

| Category | Pattern (path or diff content) | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Network layer | path under `/network/`, `/api/`, `/http/`, `/rpc/`, `/graphql/` | broad |
| Auth / Crypto | path under `/auth/`, `/crypto/`, `/token/`, `/session/` | narrow |
| Credential storage | diff mentions `SharedPreferences`, `EncryptedSharedPreferences`, `Keychain`, `UserDefaults`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `document.cookie`, `KeyStore` | narrow |
| Supply chain | new dependency line added in `build.gradle*`, `Podfile`, `Package.swift`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod` | narrow |
| DB migrations | path under `migrations/`, `*.sql`, `Migration.kt`, `schema.prisma`, Flyway / Liquibase configs, `alembic/` | narrow |
| Deserialization | Jackson / Gson / `kotlinx.serialization` config blocks; unsafe Python-pickle usage, `XMLDecoder`, `ObjectInputStream` in diff | narrow |

**Threshold (false-positive control):**

- **At least one narrow pattern** → full security review (same as `risk_areas` trigger).
- **Two or more broad patterns** → full security review.
- **Exactly one broad pattern, no narrow** → **scoped review** — launch `security-expert` with a narrowed prompt that names the specific surface (e.g. "audit the network layer for regressions only"), not a full audit. The intent is to reduce false-positive review cost on diffs that touch a security-relevant area only incidentally.
- **No pattern + no `risk_areas`** → security-expert does not fire. Other Phase D experts may still trigger.

**Override.** `--skip-security-review` on `finalize` (Tolerance flags above) turns off both `risk_areas` and pattern-based security triggers for the round. Recorded verbatim in `<slug>-finalize.md`'s `acknowledged risks` section with the user's reason. Discouraged.

**Source.** Patterns are evaluated against the unified diff between the remote default branch's merge-base and `HEAD` (same derivation as Phase A's diff materialisation). Generate the diff with rename detection enabled (`git diff -M`) so a moved file appears under its new path. Path-based patterns match against the **new** path of each diff entry. Diff-content patterns match only against added/modified hunks — a pure rename without content change inserts no hunks, so it cannot match content patterns; it can, however, match path patterns when the rename moves the file into a security-relevant directory (e.g. into `/auth/`). Pure rename metadata alone (mode change, perms) is not a content trigger.

### Handling expert findings

Experts produce deeper, higher-risk findings. Apply the same severity × confidence gate as Phase A:

- For security-critical findings that come in at confidence 50, rely on the code-reviewer's **Critical-risk exception** (see `developer-workflow-experts/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Critical-risk exception): the finding is included with a `[please verify]` marker prefixed to the `issue` field. Treat such findings as BLOCK and attempt a fix; if fix is out-of-scope, escalate.
- performance / architecture + critical at confidence ≥ 75: fix if local to the diff; escalate if requires broader rework.
- Do not introduce a parallel "always fix at 50" rule — the rubric is defined once in `code-reviewer.md` and inherited by Phase D experts.

### `test-coverage-expert` (conditional)

Late-stage coverage audit that complements the early `/check` Phase 3.5 gate (#154). Catches cases the early gate cannot — declared Test Cases that were not implemented, data-layer changes that landed without integration tests, and gaps that the engineer agent missed.

**Trigger when ANY:**

1. The diff adds a new public API symbol that has no matching test file.
2. `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` declares Test Cases that have no matching implementation in the test sources for this slug. Cross-reference is by Test Case `Type` (#153) plus name / file mention — interpreted by the engineer agent, not regex.
3. The diff touches data layer / repository / service / use-case files without introducing or updating tests for them.
4. The caller passed `--coverage-audit` (force-on).

**Skip when ANY:**

1. The diff is trivial (single file, < 50 LOC, no new public API, refactor-only).
2. The caller passed `--skip-coverage-audit` (recorded in the finalize report verbatim with the user reason).
3. The project has no test infrastructure for the affected module — short-circuit with a follow-up issue ("add test harness for X"). Do NOT silently skip.

**Implementation note — no new agent role.** This trigger reuses the existing engineer agents. Phase D launches the matching engineer (`kotlin-engineer` / `swift-engineer` / `compose-developer` / `swiftui-developer`) with a coverage-audit prompt instead of a code-review prompt. The platform routing follows standard project-detection rules. The existing agents already understand the codebase's test conventions; a new agent role would duplicate them.

**What the audit produces.** The engineer agent reads `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md`, the diff, and the test files in the diff, then produces `swarm-report/<slug>-coverage-audit.md` with the schema below. If gaps are found, the agent (in the same Task call) writes the missing tests and re-runs `/check` — author-fixes-tests rule applies.

**Schema for `swarm-report/<slug>-coverage-audit.md`:**

```markdown
# Coverage audit: <slug>

**Date:** <ISO date>
**Slug:** <slug>
**Triggered by:** new-public-api | tp-tc-mismatch | data-layer-no-tests | --coverage-audit
**Verdict:** PASS | GAPS_RESOLVED | ESCALATE

## Inputs

- Test plan: `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md` (or `N/A: no test plan`)
- Diff against: `origin/<base>` (commit hash range)
- Test files in diff: <list>

## Cross-reference

| TC ID | Type | Status | Test file |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC-1 | unit | covered | `src/test/.../FooSpec.kt` |
| TC-2 | ui-instrumentation | gap | — |
| ... |

## Public API audit

| Symbol | File | Status | Test file |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoginViewModel` | `feature/auth/.../LoginViewModel.kt` | covered | `LoginViewModelTest.kt` |
| `RateLimiter.allow()` | `core/.../RateLimiter.kt` | gap | — |

## Gaps and resolution

- (gap-1) TC-2 `Login error state` (ui-instrumentation) — added `LoginScreenInstrumentedTest` covering the error state.
- (gap-2) `RateLimiter.allow()` had no unit test — added `RateLimiterTest.allow_blocks_after_threshold`.

## /check after fixes

verdict: PASS
passed: [build, lint, typecheck, tests, coverage]
```

The verdict drives Phase D outcome:

- `PASS` — all cross-reference and public-API rows covered before audit. Phase D continues with other experts.
- `GAPS_RESOLVED` — gaps existed, agent wrote missing tests, `/check` returned PASS. Treated as PASS for Phase D round-end exit; the audit file lists the fixes for the finalize report.
- `ESCALATE` — gaps existed, agent could not write a viable test in 3 attempts, OR a gap is structurally untestable (covered by the same diagnosis path the regression-test stage uses). Treated as a BLOCK finding; round budget rules apply.

The override flag `--skip-coverage-audit` is documented in §Inputs (Tolerance flags); when set it records the skip reason in the finalize report's `acknowledged risks` section.

---

## Mechanical verification between phases

After **any** code modification within a round (Phase A fix, Phase B auto-fix, Phase C fix, Phase D fix), re-invoke `/check`. If `/check` returns FAIL:

1. Log which phase's fix introduced the failure.
2. Attempt a narrow repair — **1 attempt max**. At the finalize stage the code already passed `/check` once, so a regression from a finalize fix signals that the fix itself was wrong; repeated retry usually compounds the problem rather than converging.
3. If still failing → revert the fix and keep the originating finding **as BLOCK** on the round's list — the finding is not resolved, so it counts against the round budget. Continue with the remaining phases of the round (they may still find other issues), but do not mark the reverted finding as "acknowledged risk" — that label is reserved for items the user knowingly accepts at the end.
4. If the round ends with any such unresolved BLOCK, go to the next round. If round 3 ends with unresolved BLOCKs, exit with ESCALATE.

Do not let `/check` failures cascade — a broken build blocks further review and creates noise. But also do not use "revert + continue" as a way to silently ship a BLOCK.

---

## Report

Save `swarm-report/<slug>-finalize.md` on exit (PASS or ESCALATE):

```markdown
# Finalize: <slug>

**Date:** <date>
**Rounds run:** N (of 3 max)
**Exit:** PASS | ESCALATE
**Escalation reason:** <only if ESCALATE>

## Rounds

### Round 1
- Phase A (code-reviewer): verdict, N findings (K BLOCK, M WARN, L NIT). Fixes applied: X.
- Phase B (/simplify): Y files changed, auto-fixed.
- Phase C (pr-review-toolkit): breakdown per agent, or `skipped` if plugin not installed.
- Phase D (experts): triggered: [security-expert, ...]; findings, fixes.
- `/check` after round: PASS | FAIL (reason)

### Round 2
...

## Unresolved BLOCKs (on ESCALATE only)

Findings that could not be fixed and were NOT downgraded. Populated only when the
finalize stage exits ESCALATE — lists BLOCKs that remain after `max_rounds` rounds, or BLOCKs
whose fix broke `/check` and was reverted (per §Mechanical verification). The user
must decide: return to implementation, accept as risk, or re-scope.

| Severity | Confidence | Category | Finding | Phase | Round | File:Line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BLOCK (critical) | 75 | security | Token logged in clear | D | 3 | src/auth/Logger.kt:23 |

## Remaining findings (not auto-fixed)

Non-BLOCK items surfaced for reviewer awareness — they do not block exit with PASS.

| Severity | Confidence | Category | Finding | Phase | File:Line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WARN | 60 | quality | Inconsistent error logging | A | src/foo/Bar.kt:142 |
| NIT  | 75 | consistency | Unused import of X in new file | B | ... |

## Acknowledged risks

Findings that the user explicitly decided to accept (e.g., during escalation). Not auto-populated — the user marks items here when handing control back for the run to continue. Distinct from "Unresolved BLOCKs" (which the finalize stage could not close).

## Commits added during finalize

- <hash> <message>
```

### Chat summary on exit

After saving the report, post a chat summary (≤20 lines):

**PASS exit:**
- One sentence: "Finalize: PASS after N round(s). Code is ready for acceptance."
- Bullets: N findings fixed (by category: security X, quality Y, style Z). If 0 findings: state that.
- One line: "Next step: `/acceptance`"

**ESCALATE exit:**
- One sentence: "Finalize: ESCALATE after N round(s). X unresolved BLOCK(s) require decision."
- Bullets (max 5): unresolved BLOCKs — one bullet per BLOCK with category + one-line description. If >5 BLOCKs: list top 5 by severity.
- ONE question: which BLOCK to resolve first, or ask user to choose: accept risk / continue implementing / re-scope.
- One line: options — "Accept risks and proceed to `/acceptance`" OR "Return to implementation with a new task".

Do NOT paste the report table into chat. The file is for reference only.

---

## Scope rules

- **In scope:** reviewing and improving the quality of code *related to the current diff*. Delegating fixes to engineer agents. Invoking `/check` after each mutation.
- **Out of scope:** writing new features, changing task scope, verifying functional correctness (acceptance), architectural redesign (escalate — this is a new task).
- **Prefer** to keep fixes inside the files touched by the original change. Minimal, necessary edits in adjacent files are allowed when a finding explicitly requires them — e.g., Phase C's `pr-test-analyzer` may demand adding tests in a sibling test file, and Phase B's `/simplify` may extract a duplicated helper into an existing utility module. In every such case, keep the edit narrowly scoped to what the finding requires.
- **Never** re-scope the task under the guise of "cleanup". If a finding points to a structural issue beyond narrow-fix reach → escalate, do not refactor.
- **Never** silently skip Phase A — `code-reviewer`'s plan-conformance check is the anchor. If the agent fails to launch for infrastructure reasons, stop and escalate.
- **Never** run forever. Stop after `max_rounds` rounds (default 3) and report.

---

## Escalation

Stop and report to caller when:

- After `max_rounds` rounds (default 3), BLOCK findings remain unresolved
- `/check` fails and the fix doesn't converge after 1 retry
- A BLOCK finding requires refactoring beyond the diff scope
- An expert finding demands architectural changes (new modules, dependency reorg)
- Required engineer agent (e.g., `kotlin-engineer`) is not installed but needed for a fix

When escalating: state which phase escalated, what the unresolved findings are, and what the caller needs to decide (accept risks, return to implementation with a new task, architectural redesign, etc.).

---

## Integration notes

- **Manual invocation** is the primary mode: pre-PR cleanup on a feature branch, periodic quality audit on an old branch, review of a branch before marking draft PR ready.
- The skill requires `code-reviewer` from `developer-workflow-experts` (sibling hard dependency). The `pr-review-toolkit` trio is optional: if the plugin is installed (from `claude-plugins-official`), Phase C runs; otherwise Phase C is skipped with a log entry and the round continues through Phases D and beyond.

---

## Dependencies this skill requires

- Hard deps (declared in `plugins/developer-workflow/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`):
  - `developer-workflow-experts` — for `code-reviewer`, `security-expert`, `performance-expert`, `architecture-expert`
- Optional soft-ref (install separately, Phase C auto-skips when absent):
  - `pr-review-toolkit` (marketplace: `claude-plugins-official`) — for `pr-test-analyzer`, `silent-failure-hunter`, `type-design-analyzer`
- Built-in skills:
  - `/simplify` — Claude Code's built-in reuse/quality/efficiency pass
  - `/check` — this plugin's mechanical verification utility
