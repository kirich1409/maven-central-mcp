## Plugins

### maven-mcp

Maven dependency intelligence for JVM projects. Auto-registers an MCP server that provides tools for version lookup, dependency auditing, vulnerability checking, and changelog tracking across Maven Central, Google Maven, and custom repositories.

**Features:**
- Version intelligence — stability-aware selection, upgrade type classification
- Project scanning — Gradle, Maven, version catalogs
- Repository auto-discovery from build files
- Vulnerability checking via [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/)
- Changelog tracking — GitHub releases, AndroidX, AGP, Firebase release notes
- Artifact search across Maven Central

**Skills:** `/check-deps`, `/latest-version`, `/dependency-changes`

See [`plugins/maven-mcp/`](plugins/maven-mcp/) for full documentation.

### sensitive-guard

Prevents sensitive data (secrets, PII) from reaching AI servers. Scans files via a PreToolUse hook before they are read into conversation.

**Features:**
- Secret detection via [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) (700+ rules)
- PII detection — email, SSN, credit cards, IBAN (custom regex)
- Interactive allow/block prompt per finding
- Project and global allowlists (SHA-256 hashed)
- Configurable patterns and tools

See [`plugins/sensitive-guard/`](plugins/sensitive-guard/) for full documentation.

### developer-workflow

Developer workflow skills and expert agents for the full development cycle — from task implementation to QA testing to PR merge.

**Skills:**
- `/create-pr` — create a draft or ready PR with auto-generated title, description, labels, and reviewer suggestions
- `/triage-feedback` — analyze feedback (PR/MR comments or user-pasted text): categorize, prioritize, detect patterns, and write a structured action plan — no code changes or replies
- `/code-migration` — safe in-place or parallel migration of any technology in Gradle/Android/Kotlin projects
- `/kmp-migration` — full Kotlin Multiplatform migration for Android modules
- `/migrate-to-compose` — migrate View-based Android UI (Activity, Fragment, custom View) to Jetpack Compose
- `/generate-test-plan` — generate structured, prioritized test plan from spec or code
- `/acceptance` — verify a feature against its specification on a live app
- `/bug-hunt` — undirected bug hunting and QA exploration on a running app
- `/plan-review` — multi-agent review of implementation plans using PoLL consensus protocol
- `/feature-flow` — end-to-end feature orchestrator: research → decompose → implement → acceptance → create PR
- `/bugfix-flow` — end-to-end bug fix orchestrator: debug → implement → acceptance → create PR
- `/implement` — standalone implementation stage: code → simplify → quality loop → artifacts

**Agents (10):** architecture-expert, build-engineer, business-analyst, compose-developer, devops-expert, kotlin-engineer, manual-tester, performance-expert, security-expert, ux-expert

See [`plugins/developer-workflow/`](plugins/developer-workflow/) for full documentation.

### extend

Extend Claude Code built-in features with review and optimization tools.

**Skills:**
