# Binding Features Matrix

This matrix is the master classifier for every DataBinding feature encountered during Discovery.
Every binding row in `<slug>-property-map.md` gets its `bucket` value by looking up its feature
here. Per-expression overrides come from `expression-resolution.md`; per-adapter overrides come
from `adapter-resolution.md`. When signals from different sources conflict, the worst bucket wins
(see Consensus Rule below).

## Bucket definitions

**mechanical** — deterministic conversion: the skill writes the replacement with no human
judgment required. The output is a bit-for-bit behavioural equivalent of the original binding
expression. The result is verified by `/check` (build + lint). No review caveat is added to
the property map `notes` column. Examples: replacing `executePendingBindings()` with nothing,
replacing `DataBindingUtil.setContentView(…)` with the typed `XxxBinding.inflate(…)` call,
removing `lifecycleOwner = …` from the binding object.

**partial** — the skill writes a default replacement but flags it for human (or follow-up agent)
confirmation. DataBinding's runtime behaviour may differ subtly from the literal Kotlin
equivalent. The `notes` column carries the specific caveat text so the reviewer knows exactly
what to verify. A `partial` row does NOT block the screen from advancing to Phase 5 — it ships
with an inline caveat comment in host code alongside the default replacement. Review of `partial`
rows is the user's responsibility during ordinary code review; it is not a skill-managed gate.
Examples: a `LiveData` variable whose lifecycle attachment point moves from the binding object to
an explicit `observe` call; a `bind:` variable on an `<include>` that must now be wired by the
host explicitly.

**escalate** — the skill stops on this binding and records the case in the property map without
emitting a replacement fragment. No host-code write happens for this row. The user or
`kotlin-engineer` agent selects a recipe from `escalation-patterns.md` and the conversion of
the screen cannot proceed until all its escalations are resolved. Examples: any `@={…}` two-way
binding, any `Observable*`-typed variable, a `<ViewStub>`, a `<merge>` root layout.

## Feature → bucket matrix

| Feature | Bucket | Replacement strategy | Cross-ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| One-way `@{…}` — supported expression (arithmetic, logic, ternary depth ≤ 2, string template, null-coalescing, safe-unbox) | mechanical | Direct Kotlin equivalent per grammar rules | expression-resolution.md |
| One-way `@{…}` — resource reference (`@string/`, `@dimen/`, `@color/`, `@drawable/`, `@integer/`, `@bool/`) | mechanical | Wrap in `context.getString(…)` / `getDimensionPixelSize` / `ContextCompat.getColor` / `ContextCompat.getDrawable` / `getInteger` / `getBoolean` | expression-resolution.md §resource_ref |
| One-way `@{…}` — `safeUnbox(…)` / `default=` / `??` (null-coalescing with matching types) | mechanical | `expr ?: zeroPrimitive` / `expr ?: defaultVal` / Kotlin Elvis chain | expression-resolution.md §safe_unbox |
| One-way `@{…}` — `@BindingAdapter` resolved to project-local sources | mechanical | Direct function call with resolved args; disposal options apply after migration | adapter-resolution.md, escalation-patterns.md §adapter-cleanup |
| One-way `@{…}` — `@BindingAdapter` resolved to binary library (`androidx.databinding:databinding-adapters`, AppCompat, Material, etc.) | mechanical | Direct call with FQN import; add explicit dependency if AGP no longer pulls it transitively after `dataBinding = false` | adapter-resolution.md §binary |
| One-way `@{…}` — `@BindingAdapter` in a different monorepo module, module already on classpath | partial | Direct call if dependency exists; user confirms placement; duplication or extraction if not | adapter-resolution.md §monorepo |
| One-way `@{…}` — `@BindingAdapter` unresolved (no match in any source tier) | escalate | No template generated; record adapter attribute and failing lookup in notes | adapter-resolution.md §unresolved, escalation-patterns.md |
| Two-way `@={…}` on standard widgets (`EditText.text`, `Switch.isChecked`, `RadioGroup.checkedButtonId`, etc.) | escalate | TextWatcher + setter pair or OnCheckedChangeListener pair | escalation-patterns.md §two-way |
| Two-way `@={…}` on custom widget with project-local `@InverseBindingAdapter` | escalate | Decompose into `@BindingAdapter` call + `@InverseBindingAdapter` listener wiring | escalation-patterns.md §two-way-inverse |
| Listener attribute — inline lambda `android:onClick="@{() -> vm.onClick()}"` | mechanical | `setOnClickListener { vm.onClick() }` with translated lambda body | expression-resolution.md §lambda |
| Listener attribute — method reference `android:onClick="@{vm::onClick}"` | mechanical | `setOnClickListener { vm.onClick(it) }` | expression-resolution.md §lambda |
| Listener attribute — multi-listener or custom listener binding (`app:onTextChanged`, `app:onItemSelected`) | partial | DataBinding's listener method picker is non-trivial; skill writes the most likely overload but flags for review | adapter-resolution.md §overload-selection |
| `Observable*` / `ObservableField<T>` / `ObservableArrayList<T>` as variable type | escalate | Property-holder type must be replaced with `StateFlow` or `LiveData`; project-wide decision required | escalation-patterns.md §observable-decommission |
| `LiveData<T>` / `StateFlow<T>` / `Flow<T>` as variable type with `lifecycleOwner = …` on binding | partial | Skill writes subscription scaffold (`viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.collect` or `LiveData.observe`); user reviews lifecycle attachment point | escalation-patterns.md §livedata-wiring |
| `<include>` referencing a sub-layout (no `bind:` variables) | mechanical | `binding.includedLayoutId.<viewId>` — ViewBinding generates the nested binding field automatically | mechanical-transforms.md §include |
| `<include>` with `bind:variable="@{vm}"` — passes variables to sub-layout | partial | Sub-binding variables now require explicit host-side passing; skill generates the call site but user confirms correct scope | mechanical-transforms.md §include, escalation-patterns.md |
| `<merge>` as layout root | escalate | ViewBinding inflate for `<merge>` requires the two-arg `inflate(inflater, parent)` form; placement of inflate call must change in host | escalation-patterns.md §merge |
| `<ViewStub>` | escalate | DataBinding's `OnInflateListener` integration has no ViewBinding equivalent; manual `setOnInflateListener` + typed binding access required | escalation-patterns.md §viewstub |
| `<import>` declarations | mechanical | Consumed during expression resolution; no emission into host code | expression-resolution.md §static_ref |
| `<variable>` declarations | — | Not a property-map row; feeds `<slug>-variables-map.md` and informs lifecycle and escalation strategy | property-map-spec.md §variables-map |
| `@BindingMethods` / `@BindingConversion` | partial | Bucket confirmed during Discovery based on adapter chain result: if resolved adapter and conversion are both mechanical → mechanical; if conversion chain is ambiguous or type mismatch → escalate | adapter-resolution.md §BindingConversion |
| `BR` class references in host code (`binding.setVariable(BR.user, user)`, `notifyPropertyChanged(BR.x)`) | partial | `BR` disappears with DataBinding; see `escalation-patterns.md §BR references` for the decision recipe | escalation-patterns.md §BR references |
| `executePendingBindings()` calls | mechanical | Remove the call; ViewBinding has no pending-binding queue | mechanical-transforms.md §pending-bindings |
| `lifecycleOwner = viewLifecycleOwner` on the binding object | mechanical | Remove the line; if a `LiveData` row on the same screen is `partial`, lifecycle wiring is owned by that row | mechanical-transforms.md §lifecycle-owner |
| `DataBindingUtil.setContentView` / `DataBindingUtil.inflate` / `DataBindingUtil.bind` | mechanical | Replace with `XxxBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)` + `setContentView(binding.root)` for Activity; Fragment / ViewHolder variants per `mechanical-transforms.md` | mechanical-transforms.md §inflate |
| Project-local `@BindingAdapter` with all its callsites migrated — post-migration cleanup | partial | Bucket confirmed during Discovery based on disposal option chosen (keep / delete / extract to util / convert to extension / move to separate module); see adapter disposal matrix | escalation-patterns.md §Adapter cleanup |

## Reading the table during Discovery

At Discovery time the skill walks every binding expression in the scope, matches it against the
rows above (top to bottom; first match wins for single-feature expressions), and writes the
bucket and a one-line `notes` entry into the property map. When multiple rows match a single
expression, apply each and take the worst bucket (see Consensus Rule). The `Cross-ref` column
points to the reference that supplies the concrete conversion recipe or escalation detail.

At Conversion time the skill re-reads the approved property map, groups rows by bucket, and
processes `mechanical` rows first. `partial` rows are processed and the caveat from `notes` is surfaced to the user as an inline
comment alongside the default replacement — the row does not block the screen. `escalate` rows are skipped — they wait for the user's
recipe selection via `escalation-patterns.md`.

## Consensus rule

When a single binding row touches multiple features in this matrix — for example, a one-way
expression using a project-local `@BindingAdapter` whose result passes through a
`@BindingConversion` — apply each matching row independently and take the worst bucket:
`mechanical` < `partial` < `escalate`. This matches the bucket resolution rule in
`property-map-spec.md` and ensures no conversion proceeds silently when any component of it
requires human attention. Apply the rule per binding row, not per feature class across the whole
screen: a screen with both mechanical and escalate rows is not itself escalated; only the specific
rows with `escalate` bucket are blocked.
