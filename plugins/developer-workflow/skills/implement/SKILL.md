name: implement
description: >-
  Implementation stage — takes a task with optional context artifacts and produces working code.
  Designed to be called by an orchestrator or directly by the user. Accepts any task source:
  plain text description, GitHub/Jira/Linear issue URL, or a reference to an existing artifact
  (research.md, debug.md, plan.md).

  Pipeline: understand task → implement → simplify → quality loop → produce artifacts.
  Does NOT create worktrees, PRs, or run live QA — those are separate stages.

  Use when: "implement", "write the code", "fix this", "сделай", "реализуй", "напиши код",
  "пофикси", or when an orchestrator delegates the implementation stage.
  Do NOT use for: debugging/investigation (use debug), research (use research),
  PR creation (use create-pr), live QA (use acceptance).

# Implement

Implementation stage for the development pipeline. Takes a task with context, writes code,
ensures quality, produces artifacts for the next stage.

---

## Phase 1: Understand Task

### 1.1 Normalize input

The task can arrive from any source. Extract from whatever is provided:

- **What** needs to change (behavior, not files)
- **Why** (context for edge-case decisions)
- **Type**: feature or bug fix (infer from context)
- **Done criteria** — what does success look like?

| Input | How to extract |
|-------|---------------|
| Plain text | Parse directly |
| GitHub/Jira/Linear URL | Fetch the issue, read title + body + comments |
| `research.md` artifact | Read findings, recommended approach, constraints |
| `debug.md` artifact | Read root cause, reproduction steps, recommended fix direction |
| `plan.md` artifact | Read scope, approach, files to modify, acceptance criteria |
| Combination | Cross-reference all sources |

### 1.2 Read context artifacts

If artifact paths are provided (by orchestrator or user), read them:

- `swarm-report/<slug>-research.md` — approach recommendations, library choices, risks
- `swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md` — root cause, reproduction steps, fix direction
- `swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md` — scope, file list, testing strategy, acceptance criteria

If no artifacts exist — proceed from the task description alone. Do a minimal codebase
exploration to understand the change surface before writing code.

### 1.3 Generate slug

If not provided by the orchestrator, derive a slug from the task: kebab-case, 2-4 words.
Example: "Fix login crash on empty email" → `fix-login-empty-email`.

---

## Phase 2: Implement

### 2.1 Choose implementation approach

| Context | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| `plan.md` exists | Follow the plan step by step |
| `debug.md` exists | Apply fix in the direction indicated by root cause analysis |
| Neither, multi-file change | Explore codebase → design approach → implement |
| Neither, single-file change | Implement directly |

### 2.2 Delegate to specialist agents

Route code writing to the appropriate agent based on the technology:

| Domain | Agent |
|--------|-------|
| Kotlin business logic, data layer, ViewModels | `kotlin-engineer` |
| Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform UI | `compose-developer` |
| Swift business logic, data layer | `swift-engineer` |
| SwiftUI screens and components | `swiftui-developer` |
| Gradle / build system | `build-engineer` |

For changes spanning multiple domains — delegate each part to the appropriate specialist
sequentially or in parallel when independent.

If the change is small and doesn't require specialist knowledge — implement directly
without delegation.

### 2.3 Commit incrementally

One logical change per commit. For multi-step implementations — one commit per meaningful
stage (e.g., model, repository, UI layer). Stage specific files, never `git add .`.

---

## Phase 3: Simplify

After implementation is complete, invoke the `simplify` skill on changed files.
This reviews for reuse opportunities, code quality, and efficiency — then fixes issues found.

If simplify produces changes — commit them separately.

---

## Phase 4: Quality Loop

Run quality gates sequentially. A failure triggers a fix cycle before advancing.

### Gate 1: Build
Compile the project. Fix all build errors.

### Gate 2: Static analysis
Lint, formatting, unused imports. Fix violations.

### Gate 3: Tests
Run unit + integration tests. Fix failures that are in scope of current changes.
Pre-existing failures — note for the report, don't fix.

### Gate 4: Semantic self-review
Launch the `code-reviewer` agent with:
- Original task description (verbatim)
- Plan artifact path (if exists)
- `git diff` of all changes

The reviewer checks: does the code solve the original problem? Is there scope creep?
Are acceptance criteria met?

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PASS | Proceed to gate 5 |
| WARN | Proceed, note issues in quality report |
| FAIL | Fix critical issues, re-run gate 4 (max 3 cycles) |

### Gate 5: Expert reviews (conditional)

Launch only when relevant, in parallel:

| Expert | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| `security-expert` | Auth, encryption, tokens, network, permissions, user data |
| `performance-expert` | Lists, DB queries, image loading, hot loops, large collections |
| `architecture-expert` | New modules, dependency direction, public API changes |

No triggers matched → skip.

### Gate 6: Intent check
Re-read original task + plan. Verify the diff addresses them. If drift detected — fix or flag.

### Iteration limits

- Per gate: max 3 fix attempts. Still failing → escalate.
- Total loop: max 5 full iterations. Not converging → escalate.

---

## Phase 5: Produce Artifacts

### Implementation artifact

Save to `swarm-report/<slug>-implement.md`:

```
# Implementation: <slug>

**Task:** <original task description>
**Type:** Feature / Bug fix
**Date:** <date>

## What Was Done
<summary of changes>

## Files Changed
- <file path> — <what and why>

## Key Decisions
- <decision> — <reasoning>

## Commits
- <hash> <message>
```

### Quality artifact

Save to `swarm-report/<slug>-quality.md`:

```
# Quality: <slug>

**Date:** <date>
**Status:** PASS / FAIL (escalated)

## Gates
| # | Gate | Result | Attempts |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Build | PASS/FAIL | N |
| 2 | Static analysis | PASS/FAIL | N |
| 3 | Tests | PASS/FAIL | N |
| 4 | Semantic review | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |
| 5 | Expert reviews | PASS/SKIP | — |
| 6 | Intent check | PASS/DRIFT | — |

## Issues Found and Fixed
- <issue> — <fix applied>

## Expert Review Findings
<per expert, if any ran>

## Acknowledged Risks
<WARN items from semantic review, if any>
```

---

## Escalation

Stop and report to the orchestrator / user when:

- Scope is **2x+ larger** than initially estimated
- A quality gate fails after **3 fix attempts**
- A **new dependency** is needed that wasn't in the plan
- **Multiple valid approaches** exist with no clear winner
- Found a **conflict with existing code** requiring a design decision
- Task requires **access or information** that is unavailable

When escalating: state what was tried, what the options are, what decision is needed.

---

## Scope Rules

- **In scope:** everything described in the task / plan / debug artifact
- **Adjacent obvious fixes** (missing import, typo in new code): fix silently
- **Out of scope, non-obvious** (pre-existing failures, unrelated issues): note in report, don't fix
- **No "while I'm here" improvements** — no refactoring, no extra features, no docs for unchanged code
