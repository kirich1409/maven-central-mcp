# Research

Parallel expert investigation of a topic before implementation. The Research Consortium
launches up to 5 domain agents simultaneously, each investigating their slice independently,
then synthesizes findings into a single structured report.

**Synthesis-bias prevention.** The core invariant: **agents that gather data never synthesize
it.** Each gather-agent runs in isolation with no visibility into the others — only the
orchestrator merges their findings. This gather/synthesize separation is what makes the
consortium worth the cost; preserve it across every change.

A second, optional layer is the post-synthesis review: in product-angled topics a separate
`business-analyst` agent challenges the merged report (Phase 4 `business-analyst` mode);
in purely technical topics the orchestrator runs a self-check against a fixed checklist
(`tech-sanity` mode). The reviewer layer is a defence-in-depth, not the core value.

---

## Phase 1: Scope the Research

Extract from the user's request:
- **Topic** — what is being investigated
- **Context** — why this matters now
- **Constraints** — known boundaries (KMP, no new deps, deadline)

Select expert tracks:

| Track | Include when |
|---|---|
| **Codebase** | Topic touches existing code, patterns, or modules |
| **Web** | See criteria below — conditional, skip for purely internal topics |
| **Docs** | Topic involves specific libraries/frameworks with external documentation |
| **Dependencies** | Topic involves adding, replacing, or evaluating JVM/KMP deps |
| **Architecture** | Topic affects module boundaries, layer design, or API contracts |

**Web track inclusion** — launch when ANY of the following holds, otherwise skip:
- Topic compares against industry practices outside our code.
- Involves external libraries/frameworks/protocols whose best practices may diverge from the codebase.
- Benchmarks, post-mortems, or articles on similar problems are needed.
- The question explicitly asks about "industry consensus" / "how big projects do it".

Skipping Web on purely internal topics avoids generic web noise and saves a track for
something that adds signal.

### Clarifying questions (round-loop)

Use plan-mode pacing for any clarification: **one question per round**, wait for the answer, then re-evaluate. Multiple rounds are fine; multiple questions in one round are not. Each question must be the single most blocking ambiguity right now — not a checklist of mild curiosities.

When to ask:
- **Scope is genuinely ambiguous** (multiple valid interpretations that lead to different expert tracks or different success criteria).
- **A constraint is missing without which the redirect / consortium decision flips** (e.g. KMP-only vs Android-only changes which tracks are relevant).

When NOT to ask:
- Mild gaps the consortium can fill itself (let agents gather, surface gaps in Open Questions).
- Stylistic preferences that don't change the recommendation.
- Anything the auto-review step (Phase 4) would catch.

State the assumed scope when proceeding without asking. Resume Phase 1 from the top after each answered round in case the answer reshuffles track selection or triggers the min-2-tracks redirect.

### Minimum-2-tracks rule

If the topic resolves to **only one** expert track after applying selection criteria, do NOT launch the consortium. The synthesis-bias prevention machinery only pays off when ≥2 independent perspectives are merged. Redirect instead:

| Single track | Redirect to |
|---|---|
| Codebase only | Delegate to a single `Explore` agent inline |
| Docs only | Use `Context7` / library-docs lookup directly |
| Dependencies only | Use `maven-mcp:check-deps` or `latest-version` |
| Architecture only | Delegate to `architecture-expert` agent directly |
| Web only | Answer inline with `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` |

Report the redirect in one line ("Topic is narrow — handing off to {target} instead of running the consortium"), then exit. Do not create state or report artifacts for redirected topics.

Generate kebab-case slug from the topic (e.g., `ktor-migration`, `push-notifications`):
- Artifact: `./swarm-report/<slug>-research.md`
- State: `./swarm-report/research-<slug>-state.md`

---

## Phase 2: Launch Research Consortium

Launch all selected agents **in a single message** for maximum parallelism. Each works
independently — never share findings between agents.

Use the prompt templates in [`references/expert-prompts.md`](references/expert-prompts.md)
verbatim per agent. The reference covers all 5 tracks (Codebase / Web / Docs / Dependencies /
Architecture) with their tools and required structure.

### State persistence

Before launching, create `./swarm-report/research-<slug>-state.md`:

```markdown
# Research State: {topic}

Slug: {slug}
Status: investigating
Started: {date}

## Scope
- Topic: {topic}
- Context: {why}
- Constraints: {known boundaries}

## Expert Tracks
- [ ] Codebase — {launched | skipped: reason}
- [ ] Web — {launched | skipped: reason}
- [ ] Docs — {launched | skipped: reason}
- [ ] Dependencies — {launched | skipped: reason}
- [ ] Architecture — {launched | skipped: reason}

## Findings
(populated as agents report back)
```

Update as each agent completes.

---

## Phase 3: Synthesize Findings

Combine findings into a structured report. Cross-reference for:
- **Convergence** — multiple experts independently agree (strongest signal)
- **Contradictions** — surface explicitly, do not paper over
- **Gaps** — what no expert covered
- **Dependencies between findings** — one expert's conclusion changes another's relevance

### Report structure

Save to `./swarm-report/<slug>-research.md`:

```markdown
# Research: {topic}

Date: {date}
Experts consulted: {tracks that ran}
Auto-review mode: {business-analyst | tech-sanity}

## Problem / Question Summary
{2–3 sentences: what was investigated and why}

## Approaches Found

Lay out 2–3 viable approaches in parallel before the recommendation. If only one is
genuinely viable, state that explicitly with reasons others were ruled out.

### Approach 1: {name}
- **Description:** ...
- **Trade-offs:** ...
- **Evidence:** {which experts found this, key details}
- **Compatibility:** ...

### Approach 2: {name}
...

### Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Approach 1 | Approach 2 | Approach 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort | S/M/L | ... | ... |
| Maintainability | + / − | ... | ... |
| Compatibility | ... | ... | ... |
| Risk | low/med/high | ... | ... |

Skip the table when one approach dominates on every dimension.

## Library / Dependency Recommendations
| Library | Version | KMP | Vulnerabilities | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Risks and Concerns
- {risk — severity: critical/major/minor}

## Recommendation
{Preferred approach with reasoning, citing specific expert findings.}

## Open Questions
- {What needs user decision or could not be determined}

## Sources
- {URLs, doc references, codebase locations}
```

---

## Phase 4: Auto-Review

Pick the review mode based on the topic profile, then record it in the report header
`Auto-review mode:` field as one of `business-analyst` or `tech-sanity` (not the literal
pipe — pick one).

### Mode selection

Use **`business-analyst`** when the topic has a product / scope angle:
- Decision affects feature scope, MVP boundaries, time-to-market, or user-facing trade-offs.
- The question contains an implicit or explicit "what to build" component (not only "how to build").
- The decision touches SLA / SLO / cost / business risk.

Use **`tech-sanity`** (lightweight self-check, no agent launch) when the topic is purely
technical with no product angle — e.g. "which DI", "which serializer", "which test runner",
"sync vs async retries". Running business-analyst here adds tokens and latency without
producing actionable output.

**Tiebreaker.** When the topic could plausibly fit either mode (e.g. "Coil vs Glide" where
the technical pick subtly affects app size and MVP scope), default to `tech-sanity`. Promote
to `business-analyst` only if the report's recommendation materially depends on a product /
scope judgement that the gatherers did not make. The cost asymmetry is real — `tech-sanity`
is free, `business-analyst` is a full agent launch — so bias toward the cheaper option when
in doubt.

### Mode `business-analyst`

Launch the `business-analyst` agent against the synthesized report. The reviewer holds a
distinct perspective from the gatherers — they check completeness, product sense,
practical viability:

```
Review this research report for completeness and practical viability.

{full research report}

Check:
1. Are all approaches properly evaluated with trade-offs?
2. Any obvious alternatives missed?
3. Do risks cover both technical and product concerns?
4. Is the recommendation well-supported by evidence?
5. Are open questions the right ones — nothing critical missing?
6. Does the recommendation align with practical constraints (time, team skills, maintenance)?

List gaps with severity (critical / major / minor).
Respond in the same language as the research topic description.
```

### Mode `tech-sanity`

Run a self-check pass on the report against this checklist (no agent — direct verification):

1. **Approaches evaluated ≥2** — at least two viable options laid out side-by-side, or an
   explicit justification why only one survived.
2. **Risks listed** — each approach has its risks called out with severity.
3. **Recommendation justified** — the chosen option cites specific expert findings, not
   "feels right".
4. **Sources cited** — every non-obvious claim links to a codebase location, doc URL, or
   dependency coordinate.

If any item fails, fix the report before saving (re-run a track or fill the gap from the
existing findings). Do not promote to `business-analyst` mode just because the checklist
fails — the failure is a content gap, not a mode mismatch.

### Handle findings (both modes)

- **No issues** → save artifact
- **Minor** → incorporate inline, note changes
- **Major/critical, fillable** → re-run the relevant expert track
- **Major/critical, not fillable** → add to Open Questions, flag for user

---

## Phase 5: Save & Summarize

Save the report to `./swarm-report/<slug>-research.md`. Mark state file `done`.

Post a chat summary that lets the user decide without opening the file:

1. One sentence: topic, tracks ran, overall recommendation.
2. 3–5 bullets: most decision-relevant findings/blockers/constraints.
3. If open questions block the next step: enter the same plan-mode round-loop as Phase 1
   — ask exactly ONE now, labeled `"Question 1 of N:"`, wait for the answer, then ask the
   next blocker on the next round. The rest stay in the report's Open Questions until
   their round comes. Stop the loop the moment no blockers remain — non-blocking gaps
   ride along in the report.
4. One line: suggested next step.

**Hard limit:** ≤30 lines in chat. No tables, no source lists, no inline citations.

### Suggest next action

| Situation | Suggested action |
|---|---|
| Feature is clear, single task, ready to build | Plan mode + start implementing |
| Complex approach, needs validation | Plan mode → `/multiexpert-review` |
| Research revealed a bug, not a feature need | Plan mode for the fix |
| Open questions block progress | List, ask user to resolve |
| Multiple viable approaches, no clear winner | Present trade-offs, ask user to pick |

Frame as actionable proposal, not a question.

## Red Flags / STOP Conditions

Stop and escalate when:
- **Scope explosion** — topic is much larger than it appeared. Report findings, propose narrowing.
- **Contradictory requirements** — user constraints conflict. Present, ask which takes priority.
- **No viable approach** — all candidates have critical blockers. Report honestly.
- **Missing access** — research needs internal systems / paid APIs / credentials. List what's needed.
- **Stale/conflicting web data** — sources disagree or look outdated. Flag uncertainty.

## Output Format and Location

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Research report | `./swarm-report/<slug>-research.md` | Final synthesized findings |
| State file | `./swarm-report/research-<slug>-state.md` | Compaction-resilient progress tracking |
| Chat summary | — | ≤30-line user-facing post-save output |

The research report is the primary deliverable. The state file is operational and may be
deleted after completion.
