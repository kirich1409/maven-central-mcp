# developer-workflow

Claude Code plugin with skills for developer workflow habits — safe code migration, preparing branches for code review, and managing the full PR lifecycle.

## Skills

### `implement-task`

Orchestrates the full development cycle for any implementation task:
- Creates an isolated worktree, timeboxes exploration, selects the best-matching sub-skill
- Brainstorms design for multi-file changes; follows TDD throughout
- Creates a draft PR early, runs quality loop (`prepare-for-pr` + `code-review`), then marks the PR ready
- Delegates CI/CD monitoring and review to `pr-drive-to-merge`

Explicit-only — invoke directly with `/developer-workflow:implement-task`.

### `create-pr`

Creates a pull request or merge request for the current branch:
- Auto-generates title from branch name and commit history
- Produces a structured description from the diff
- Selects labels from the repo's existing label set
- Suggests reviewers from recent git history on changed files
- Supports GitHub and GitLab, draft or ready-for-review

### `code-migration`

Guides safe, verified technology migrations in Gradle/Android/Kotlin/KMP projects:
- Discovers what needs migrating by reading the target (file, class, directory, or module)
- Chooses the right strategy: **in-place** (small, well-tested targets) or **parallel** (many callers, large scope, module restructuring)
- Snapshots current behavior before touching any code (tests / screenshots / API checklist)
- Migrates with green builds at every step
- Verifies nothing changed; presents visual diffs to user for approval
- Cleans up old technology: dead code, unused Gradle deps, stale imports

Examples: Java Date → Kotlin Date, XML layouts → Jetpack Compose, data binding → view binding, RxJava → coroutines.

Use when migrating code from one technology to another within an existing project.

### `prepare-for-pr`

Runs a quality loop over branch changes before creating a PR:
- Build → Simplify → Self-review → Lint/Tests
- Loops until only minor issues remain
- Fixes only what belongs to the current changes
- Asks the user when a problem is caused by something outside the current scope

Use after implementation is complete, before creating the PR.

### `pr-drive-to-merge`

Drives an existing PR/MR to merge:
- Monitors CI/CD checks; fixes failures caused by current changes
- Triages reviewer comments autonomously (BLOCKING/IMPORTANT → fix, OPTIONAL → acknowledge, OUT OF SCOPE → ask user)
- Responds to and resolves every comment thread
- Requests re-review after fixes, loops until merge requirements are met
- Asks the user only when a problem is outside the current PR scope

Use after the PR is created.

### `kmp-migration`

Guides a full migration of an Android module to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):
- Assesses the module, confirms target platforms, checks Kotlin version and module isolation
- Audits every dependency for KMP compatibility using `maven-mcp` tools
- Walks through plugin setup, source set restructuring, and dependency splitting
- Covers iOS framework exposure (CocoaPods, SPM, direct XCFramework)
- Verifies all targets compile and tests pass; cleans up Android-only artifacts

Use when migrating a module to share code with iOS, JVM, or other platforms.
