name: multiexpert-review
description: >-
  Review documentation artifacts (plan, spec, test-plan) with a panel of independent expert
  agents before commit. Use when asked to review a plan, spec, test-plan, or similar
  documentation artifact. Uses the PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators) consensus protocol.
  Invoke on phrases: "review the plan", "review the spec", "check the plan", "validate the
  approach", "multi-expert review", "panel review", "план ревью", "проверь план", "оцени план",
  "check the spec", or after exiting Plan Mode and wanting independent expert evaluation before
  implementation. Also invoke when the user says "is this plan good?", "what did I miss?",
  "sanity check this", "review this before I start", "check my approach", or wants multiple
  viewpoints on an implementation strategy. Do NOT invoke for code review (use code-reviewer
  agent instead) or PR review.

# Multi-Expert Review

Multi-agent independent review of an implementation plan, followed by consensus synthesis.

## Why This Exists

A single reviewer has blind spots. Different experts catch different problems — an architect
spots coupling issues, a security engineer finds auth gaps, a performance expert flags N+1 queries.
Independent parallel review prevents groupthink: each agent forms their own opinion before seeing
anyone else's, which surfaces more diverse issues than sequential discussion.

The core value is not that individual reviews are better — it's that **multiple independent
perspectives surface issues that any single reviewer would miss**, and the structured synthesis
makes disagreements and consensus explicit rather than hidden.

## Protocol: PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators)

The review follows the Panel of LLM Evaluators protocol, backed by research showing that
independent panels outperform iterative debates (debates cause conformity and suppress dissent):

1. **Independent parallel review** — each agent reviews the plan from their expertise, unaware of other reviewers
2. **Structured output** — every agent returns issues with severity and confidence scores
3. **Confidence-weighted synthesis** — the orchestrator aggregates results, weighting by domain relevance
4. **Explicit uncertainty** — disagreements between agents surface as "requires decision", not silently resolved

## Workflow

```
┌─ Read plan (track source: Plan Mode / file / conversation)
│       ↓
│  Discover available agents (only real, existing agents)
│       ↓
│  Pre-select relevant agents → present multi-select to user
│       ↓
│  Spawn selected agents in parallel (independent review)
│       ↓
│  Collect all reviews
│       ↓
│  Synthesize verdict (PoLL aggregation, or single-agent verdict)
│       ↓
│  Present verdict
│       ↓
│  ┌─ PASS → Done (proceed to implementation)
│  ├─ CONDITIONAL → Fix plan at source → Re-review ─┐
│  └─ FAIL → Fix plan at source → Re-review ────────┘
│                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
         (max 3 review cycles)
```

### Allowed Transitions

The review follows a strict state machine. Only these transitions are valid:

```
Read Plan    → Discover Agents
Discover     → Select Agents
Select       → Parallel Review
Review       → Synthesize
Synthesize   → Verdict
Verdict:PASS → Done
Verdict:COND → Fix Plan
Verdict:WARN → Done          (test-plan branch only — see Test-Plan Branch)
Verdict:FAIL → Fix Plan
Fix Plan     → Re-review (back to Parallel Review with same agents)
Re-review    → Synthesize → Verdict (same cycle)
```

**Forbidden transitions:**
- Cannot skip from Read Plan directly to Review (must discover and select agents first)
- Cannot go from Verdict back to Discover (agents are locked after first selection)
- Cannot go from Fix Plan to Done (must re-review after fixing)

**Cycle limit:** maximum 3 full review cycles (initial + 2 re-reviews). If the plan still has
blockers after 3 cycles, stop and escalate to the user — the plan may need a fundamentally
different approach rather than incremental fixes.

## Persistence (compaction resilience)

For long reviews (multiple agents, re-review cycles), save state to a file so work survives
context compaction. Use `./swarm-report/multiexpert-review-state.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Multi-Expert Review State
Source: {plan_mode | file:<path> | conversation}
Review type: {implementation-plan | test-plan}
Cycle: {1 | 2 | 3} of 3
Status: {discovering | reviewing | synthesizing | fixing | done}

## Plan Summary
{goal, technologies, scope — extracted in Step 1}

## Selected Agents
- {agent1} (recommended)
- {agent2} (recommended)

## Reviews Completed
- [x] {agent1} — {severity counts: N critical, M major, K minor}
- [ ] {agent2} — pending

## Verdict History
### Cycle 1: {PASS | CONDITIONAL | FAIL | WARN}
- Blockers: {list}
- Improvements: {list}

### Cycle 2: ...
```

The `Review type` field records which protocol branch applies:
- `implementation-plan` — default behavior (Steps 1–5 below, verdicts PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL)
- `test-plan` — test-plan branch (see [Test-Plan Branch](#test-plan-branch)),
  verdicts PASS/WARN/FAIL

**Rules:**
- Create this file at the start of Step 2 (after plan is read and source is tracked)
- Update after each significant step (agent review completed, verdict synthesized, fix applied)
- Before each action — re-read the state file. Skip completed steps.
- On re-review cycles, append to Verdict History, don't overwrite

## Step 1 — Read the Plan

Locate the current plan. Check these sources in order:

1. **Active Plan Mode output** — if the user just exited Plan Mode, the plan is in conversation context
2. **File reference** — if the user points to a file (e.g., `plan.md`, `PLAN.md`, or any markdown file), read it
3. **Conversation context** — if the user described the plan in their message, extract it
4. **Ask** — if none of the above, ask the user: "Where is the plan? Is it in a file, or should I look at the Plan Mode output?"

**Track the plan source** — remember whether it came from Plan Mode, a file (save the path),
or conversation context. Step 5 needs this to know how to apply fixes.

Extract from the plan:
- **Goal** — what is being built or changed
- **Technologies** — languages, frameworks, libraries involved
- **Scope** — which modules, layers, or systems are affected
- **Key decisions** — architectural choices made in the plan

### Classify the plan — implementation-plan vs test-plan

Before moving to Step 2, determine whether the input is a **test-plan** artifact. Two signals,
combined with OR — any one is enough:

1. **YAML frontmatter type field** — the document starts with frontmatter that declares
   `type: test-plan` (the permanent artifact at `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md`) or
   `type: test-plan-receipt` (the receipt at `swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md`).
2. **Structural signature** — the document contains a `## Test Cases` section AND discrete
   TC blocks identifiable by TC-ID at any heading level (regex `^#{1,6}\s+TC-[\w-]+`, e.g.
   `### TC-1`, `#### TC-042`, `## TC-auth-01`) AND explicit priority labels from the set
   `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `P3`. All three structural markers must be present to count this
   signal.

If either signal fires → the plan is a **test-plan**. Record `Review type: test-plan` in the
state file and follow the [Test-Plan Branch](#test-plan-branch) instead of the
default flow. Otherwise record `Review type: implementation-plan` and proceed with Step 2
unchanged.

## Step 2 — Discover and Select Agents

### Discovery

Find all available agents by scanning for real agent definition files:

1. **Plugin agent directories** — `Glob("**/agents/*.md")` across plugin paths in the project
2. **Built-in subagent types** — only those listed in the system prompt under "Available agent types" (e.g., `general-purpose`, `manual-tester`, etc.)

**Critical rule: only include agents that actually exist.** Read each agent file's frontmatter
(`name`, `description`) to confirm it's real. Never invent, imagine, or assume agents that aren't
physically present as files or listed in the system prompt. If you're not sure an agent exists —
check before listing it. A phantom agent in the selection list erodes trust.

### Pre-selection

Score each discovered agent's relevance **to the specific content of this plan** based on:
- **Technology match** — the plan must specifically mention technologies, frameworks, or layers this agent specializes in. Generic "architecture" or "security" relevance is NOT enough — e.g., `security-expert` only when the plan touches auth, encryption, tokens, or user data; `architecture-expert` only when new modules, dependency direction changes, or public API modifications are involved.
- **Problem-specific value** — would this agent catch issues that others on the panel wouldn't? An agent that merely overlaps with another's coverage adds noise, not signal. Do not recommend an agent just because its domain is tangentially related.
- **Gap coverage** — does this agent cover a blind spot that the other recommended agents miss?

Mark the top-scoring agents as `recommended`. Prefer 2–3 agents, but quality over quantity — if only 1 agent is genuinely relevant, recommend just 1. Do not pad recommendations to reach a number. `general-purpose` is a fallback only when no specialist covers a genuine gap.

### Recommended agents for test-plan input

When `Review type: test-plan` was set in Step 1, pre-select these agents by default (they
replace the usual technology-based pre-selection heuristic because test-plan relevance is
driven by coverage/requirements logic, not by the tech stack):

- **`business-analyst`** (recommended) — primary reviewer for test-plan artifacts. Validates
  that every Acceptance Criterion from the spec is reflected in ≥1 Test Case, flags
  ambiguous or missing AC coverage, and catches requirement drift between spec and plan.
- **Domain specialist** (optional) — add at most one if the feature genuinely touches a
  specialist's domain: `security-expert` when spec mentions auth/encryption/tokens/PII,
  `performance-expert` when spec defines SLA/latency budget, `ux-expert` when spec covers
  a11y or user-facing flows. Do not pad — only if the spec concretely invokes that domain.

The orchestrator still uses `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the selection; the user can
override. If the user explicitly named agents, use theirs instead (same rule as default flow).

### Present Agent Selection

Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` showing all discovered agents. Recommended agents are listed first with "(Recommended)" in the label and a one-sentence reason specific to this plan (not generic descriptions). Non-recommended agents are available below — the user knows their context best.

**Explicit agent specification:** if the user named specific agents (e.g., "review with kotlin-engineer and security-expert"), skip discovery entirely and use those agents directly. No confirmation needed — the user already chose.

## Step 3 — Parallel Independent Review

Spawn each selected agent as a subagent via the `Agent` tool. **All agents launch in a single
message** to maximize parallelism.

### Review Prompt Template

Each agent receives this prompt (adapted to their expertise). The structured format is important
because the synthesis step depends on parsing severity, confidence, and domain_relevance from
each review. Without consistent structure, aggregation becomes guesswork.

```
You are reviewing an implementation plan as a {agent_role} expert.

## The Plan
{full_plan_text}

## Your Task
Review this plan from the perspective of your expertise. Be specific and actionable.

## Required Output Format

You MUST structure your response exactly as follows:

### Summary
2-3 sentence overall assessment from your perspective.

### Domain Relevance
State one of: high | medium | low — how much does this plan touch your area of expertise.

### Issues
For each issue, use this exact structure:

**Issue N: {short title}**
- **severity**: critical | major | minor
- **confidence**: high | medium | low
- **issue**: what the problem is (1-2 sentences)
- **suggestion**: what to do instead (1-2 sentences)

Severity guide:
- critical = blocks implementation or will cause serious failures
- major = significantly affects quality, performance, or maintainability
- minor = nice to have, low risk if skipped

Confidence guide:
- high = this is squarely in your domain and you're certain
- medium = relevant to your domain but you could be wrong
- low = outside your core expertise but worth flagging

Be honest about confidence — a low-confidence flag from outside your domain is still valuable,
but it should be weighted accordingly in synthesis.

Respond in the same language the plan is written in.
```

### Important Rules

- **Never share one agent's review with another** — independence is the whole point
- **All agents get the same plan text** — no summaries or interpretations
- **Don't filter or edit agent prompts based on other agents** — each is independent

## Step 4 — Synthesize Verdict

After all agents complete, the orchestrator (main session) reads all reviews and synthesizes.
This is the step where multi-agent review delivers its core value — cross-referencing independent
opinions to find signal that no single reviewer could produce alone.

**Single-agent case:** if only one agent reviewed the plan (either by user's choice or because
only one was relevant), skip cross-referencing. Present that agent's issues directly using the
same verdict format, but note that the review represents a single perspective. Convergence
signals and uncertainties sections are not applicable — omit them.

### Aggregation Rules

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Critical severity** from any agent with high confidence | → Blocker. Must be addressed. |
| **Same issue** raised by 2+ agents independently | → Escalate to critical regardless of individual severity. Multiple experts seeing the same problem = real problem. |
| **Major severity** from agent with high domain_relevance | → Important improvement. Include in verdict. |
| **Contradicting opinions** between agents | → Surface as "Uncertainty — requires decision". Present both sides with context. Do NOT silently pick one. |
| **Minor severity** or **low confidence** from single agent | → Include as suggestion, not requirement. |
| **Low domain_relevance** agent flagging an issue | → Note it but weight lower. They may be right, but it's outside their core expertise. |

Pay special attention to **convergence signals** — when agents with different expertise
independently flag the same concern, that's the strongest signal the review can produce.
Call these out explicitly in the verdict.

### Verdict Format

Present the synthesized result:

```
## Multi-Expert Review Verdict: {PASS | CONDITIONAL | FAIL}

### Blockers (must fix before implementing)
- {issue} — raised by {agent(s)}, severity: critical
  Suggestion: {what to do}

### Important Improvements (strongly recommended)
- {issue} — raised by {agent(s)}, confidence: {level}
  Suggestion: {what to do}

### Suggestions (nice to have)
- {issue}
  Suggestion: {what to do}

### Uncertainties (requires your decision)
- {topic} — {Agent A} says X, {Agent B} says Y
  Context: {why they disagree}

### Consensus
{What all agents agreed on — the strengths of the plan}
```

**Verdict criteria:**
- **PASS** — no blockers, no important improvements, or only minor suggestions
- **CONDITIONAL** — no blockers, but has important improvements that would significantly affect quality
- **FAIL** — has blockers that must be resolved before implementation makes sense

## Step 5 — Post-Review Action

This step is not optional — always execute it based on the verdict.

The action depends on **where the plan came from** (tracked in Step 1):

| Source | How to fix |
|--------|-----------|
| **Plan Mode** | Call `EnterPlanMode` with the list of issues to address |
| **File** (e.g., `plan.md`) | Edit the file directly with the improvements |
| **Conversation context** | Present the issues and work with the user to revise the plan inline |

### PASS
Confirm the plan is ready. Say so explicitly and proceed to implementation.

### CONDITIONAL
1. Present the improvements clearly
2. Ask the user: "These improvements would significantly strengthen the plan. Want to address them now?"
3. If the user agrees, fix the plan using the appropriate method for its source:
   - **Plan Mode source** → call `EnterPlanMode` with the improvement list
   - **File source** → edit the file, incorporating the improvements into the existing plan
   - **Conversation source** → work with the user to revise inline
4. Include the specific list of improvements (copy from the verdict, not a reference to it)

### FAIL
1. Present blockers clearly
2. Do not ask — directly proceed to fix the plan:
   - **Plan Mode source** → "The plan has {N} blockers. Entering Plan Mode to address them." Call `EnterPlanMode` with the blockers list and suggestions.
   - **File source** → "The plan has {N} blockers. Updating the plan file." Edit the file, adding a "## Issues to Resolve" section with the blockers, or restructure the plan to address them directly.
   - **Conversation source** → present the blockers and start working through them with the user one by one.
3. Always include the full blocker text with suggestions — don't make the user re-read the verdict.
4. After the plan is updated, automatically re-run the review (back to Step 3 with the same
   agents) to verify the issues are resolved. This is the re-review cycle from the state machine.
5. Update the state file with the new cycle number and verdict.
6. If still FAIL after 3 cycles — stop and tell the user: "The plan has failed review {N} times.
   The remaining issues may require a fundamentally different approach. Let's discuss before
   another iteration."

## Test-Plan Branch

This branch activates **only** when Step 1's detector classified the input as a test-plan
(`Review type: test-plan`). For implementation plans the branch is inert — the default flow
(Steps 2–5 above) runs unchanged. This preserves backward compatibility: nothing changes for
existing implementation-plan runs.

### Scope

When this branch is active:
- Step 2's agent pre-selection uses the test-plan roster (see [Recommended agents for
  test-plan input](#recommended-agents-for-test-plan-input)) instead of the tech-stack
  heuristic.
- Step 3's review prompt is augmented with the checklist below — each agent must answer
  every checklist item in addition to its own perspective.
- Step 4's synthesis uses PASS / WARN / FAIL verdicts (see [Verdict policy](#verdict-policy-test-plan))
  instead of PASS / CONDITIONAL / FAIL.
- Step 5 routes the receipt update accordingly and drives the revise-loop on FAIL.

### Inline Checklist (5 items)

Every agent reviewing a test-plan MUST evaluate the document against these five items and
report the status of each one explicitly in their response. Copy the items verbatim into the
review prompt so findings are comparable across agents:

- **(a) AC coverage** — every Acceptance Criterion from the linked spec has ≥1 Test Case
  that verifies it. Missing or weak mapping is a violation.
- **(b) Negative balance** — every happy-path (positive) TC has ≥2 unhappy/negative TCs
  covering the same flow (invalid input, error states, boundary violations, concurrent or
  race conditions). A plan that is mostly happy paths violates this item.
- **(c) Edge cases present** — at least one TC is explicitly tagged as an edge case
  (boundary value, empty/null, maximum size, timezone/locale boundaries, concurrency,
  resource exhaustion, etc.). If the plan has no edge-case TC at all, this item is
  violated.
- **(d) Non-functional scenarios where applicable** — if the linked spec mentions any of
  {SLA, latency budget, throughput, a11y, auth, encryption, PII, resource limits, rate
  limits}, there must be ≥1 non-functional TC covering that concern (performance,
  accessibility, security). Applicability is driven by spec content — if the spec mentions
  none of these triggers, this item is trivially satisfied.
- **(e) Priority-risk alignment** — priorities (P0–P3) are consistent with risk assessment:
  any high-risk flow (data loss, auth, payment, destructive actions) is at P0–P1; any
  user-facing critical path is at P0–P1; trivial/informational cases are at P2–P3.
  Mismatch between stated risk and assigned priority violates this item.

### Verdict policy (test-plan)

| Verdict | Trigger | Exit condition |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **FAIL** (blocker) | Any of items **(a)**, **(b)**, **(c)** is violated | Plan MUST be revised. Drive the revise-loop up to 3 cycles. After 3 cycles still FAIL → escalate to the user (same wording as default flow). Pipeline is blocked. |
| **WARN** (non-blocking) | Items (a)–(c) all satisfied, but **(d)** or **(e)** is violated | Pipeline continues. Record `review_verdict: WARN` in the receipt along with the explicit list of violated items. No revise-loop required. |
| **PASS** (clean) | All five items satisfied | Pipeline continues unconditionally. Record `review_verdict: PASS` in the receipt. |

**Severity mapping inside a single agent's output:**
- A violated item from {(a), (b), (c)} surfaces as `severity: critical`
- A violated item from {(d), (e)} surfaces as `severity: major`

The orchestrator derives the overall verdict from the aggregated severities using the table
above. A single critical from any agent with medium-or-higher confidence is enough to
trigger FAIL, matching the Aggregation Rules in Step 4.

### Receipt integration

After Step 4 synthesis, the orchestrator updates the test-plan receipt at
`swarm-report/<slug>-test-plan.md` with:

- `review_verdict: PASS | WARN | FAIL`
- On WARN: a `review_warnings:` list enumerating the violated items (e.g. `(d)`, `(e)`)
  with one-line rationale each
- On FAIL: a `review_blockers:` list enumerating the violated items from (a)–(c) with the
  blocking finding and suggested fix (same payload as the default `## Issues to Resolve`
  section)

The receipt format itself is owned by the `generate-test-plan` skill — this skill only
writes the three fields above.

### Revise-loop (FAIL only)

Same state machine as the default flow: Verdict:FAIL → Fix Plan → Re-review, max 3 cycles.
The "Fix Plan" action edits the permanent test-plan file (the source is always the `file:`
variant for test-plan — it lives at `docs/testplans/<slug>-test-plan.md`). Each cycle
appends to `Verdict History` in the state file with the new verdict and the remaining
blockers.
