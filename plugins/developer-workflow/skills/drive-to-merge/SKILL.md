name: drive-to-merge
description: >
  Autonomous orchestrator that takes an existing PR/MR from its current state to merge. Monitors
  CI/CD, diagnoses failures, fetches review comments, categorizes them inline, proposes concrete
  fixes (snippet or delegation), delegates to implement/debug, posts replies, resolves threads,
  re-requests review (Copilot + humans), polls via ScheduleWakeup, loops until merged. Decision
  tables rendered in-session — no user-editable manifest. Default mode waits for "approve" per
  round; `--auto` proceeds without waiting; `--dry-run` stops after the first table. Final merge
  always requires explicit user confirmation. Triggers: "drive this PR to merge", "get this PR
  merged", "monitor CI and reviews", "ship this PR", "land this PR", "доведи PR до мержа",
  "веди PR", "замержь этот PR". Autonomous-mode triggers (equivalent to `--auto`): "действуй
  автономно", "без подтверждений", "auto mode", "не спрашивай", "run autonomously". Do NOT use
  for creating new PRs (use create-pr) or code written from scratch (use implement).

# Drive to Merge

Autonomous end-to-end PR driver. Takes the currently open PR/MR from its present state
and loops — diagnose CI, categorize review comments, propose fixes, delegate, push,
re-request review, wait for new activity — until the PR is merged or a true blocker
requires the user.

**Core principle:** keep the PR moving. Every obstacle (CI failure, review comment,
stalled reviewer) is a loop iteration, not a stop. The skill stops only for: the final
merge (requires user confirmation), true disagreements with a reviewer that need a
human judgement call, or mechanical dead-ends (permission denied, rebase conflict the
skill cannot resolve).

**In-session, not in files.** All analysis, categorization, and proposed actions are
rendered in the conversation as tables. A state file exists only to survive context
compaction — the user never edits it.

---

## Modes

| Mode | What it changes |
|---|---|
| default | Between rounds shows a decision table and waits for `approve` / `skip` / `stop` |
| `--auto` | Same table shown for visibility, then proceeds without waiting; merge step still asks |
| `--dry-run` | Runs analysis and renders the decision table once; makes no edits, pushes, or posts; exits |

Trigger words equivalent to `--auto`: "действуй автономно", "без подтверждений", "auto mode", "не спрашивай". The skill echoes which mode it is running in before Phase 2.

The merge step in Phase 5 **always** asks — `--auto` does not override that.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### 1.1 Detect platform

Extract hostname from the remote URL and probe the matching CLI — do not regex for `github.com` / `gitlab` literals, which miss GitHub Enterprise Server and self-hosted GitLab.

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
HOST=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed -E 's#^(https?://|git@)([^/:]+)[/:].*#\2#')

if gh auth status --hostname "$HOST" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PLATFORM=github
elif glab auth status --hostname "$HOST" >/dev/null 2>&1 || glab config get --global gitlab_uri 2>/dev/null | grep -q "$HOST"; then
  PLATFORM=gitlab
else
  echo "Unknown host $HOST — authenticate gh or glab against it and rerun." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### 1.2 Fetch PR/MR metadata

```bash
# GitHub
PR_INFO=$(gh pr view --json id,number,baseRefName,headRefName,title,body,isDraft,state,url,\
statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,labels,closingIssuesReferences)
PR_NUMBER=$(jq -r .number <<<"$PR_INFO")
PR_URL=$(jq -r .url <<<"$PR_INFO")
IS_DRAFT=$(jq -r .isDraft <<<"$PR_INFO")
BASE=$(jq -r .baseRefName <<<"$PR_INFO")
HEAD=$(jq -r .headRefName <<<"$PR_INFO")
PR_NODE_ID=$(jq -r .id <<<"$PR_INFO")     # graphql node id from the same call — no extra round-trip
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
OWNER=${REPO%/*}; REPO_NAME=${REPO#*/}

# Repository node id — needed for thread-ownership re-verify before every POST.
REPO_NODE_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='query($o:String!,$n:String!){repository(owner:$o,name:$n){id}}' \
  -F o="$OWNER" -F n="$REPO_NAME" --jq '.data.repository.id')
# COPILOT_NODE_ID is resolved lazily in Phase 3.6 and cached in the state file header.

# GitLab
MR_INFO=$(glab mr view --output json)
MR_IID=$(jq -r .iid <<<"$MR_INFO")
MR_URL=$(jq -r .web_url <<<"$MR_INFO")
IS_DRAFT=$(jq -r '.title | startswith("Draft:")' <<<"$MR_INFO")
BASE=$(jq -r .target_branch <<<"$MR_INFO")
PROJECT=$(glab repo view --output json | jq -r '.path_with_namespace | @uri')
```

If the PR/MR is already merged or closed — stop and report the final state.

### 1.3 Preconditions

Abort with a clear message if any of these fail:

- Current branch matches the PR head branch. If not — abort with `checkout <head> first; this skill does not auto-switch branches`.
- Local branch is fetched and not behind the remote head (`git fetch origin && git status -sb`).
- `gh auth status` / `glab auth status` — token valid.
- The base branch still exists on the remote.

### 1.4 State file

`swarm-report/<slug>-drive-state.md`. Slug = `<branch-with-prefix-stripped>-pr<PR_NUMBER>` (e.g. `fix/login` on PR 42 → `login-pr42`). The PR number disambiguates parallel branches that would otherwise produce the same slug (e.g. `feature/login` and `fix/login`, or two re-openings of the same branch). Verify `swarm-report/` is gitignored by running `git check-ignore -q swarm-report/`; exit 0 = ignored, non-zero = not ignored. On non-zero — abort with `swarm-report/ is not ignored by git; add swarm-report/ to .gitignore and rerun`. Do not auto-modify `.gitignore`: that creates an unrelated diff inside a PR-driving loop and surprises the user.

Schema (markdown, machine-parseable by the skill on resume):

```markdown
# Drive to Merge — <PR title>

URL: <PR URL>
Platform: github | gitlab
Mode: default | auto | dry-run
Principal: <@actor>            # gh api user --jq .login
Repository node id: <graphql node id of the repository>
PR node id: <graphql node id of the pull request>
Copilot node id: <graphql node id of copilot-pull-request-reviewer or `unavailable`>
Started: <ISO8601>
Status: running | waiting-for-user | merged | blocked

## Rounds
| # | Started | Trigger | CI | New comments | Actions | Outcome |
|---|---------|---------|----|--------------|---------|---------|

## Commitments (open threads this skill owns)
| thread_id | category | delegated_to | fix_commit_sha | replied | resolved |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|----------|

`fix_commit_sha` holds the abbreviated sha of the commit that addressed the thread (empty string if the thread is dismiss-only, no code change).

## Blockers raised
<empty | list of items the skill surfaced to the user>
```

On every resume (new session after context compaction) — re-read this file first; do not re-run analysis that already lives in a "Commitments" row unless the reviewer posted new activity.

**Mode precedence on resume.** The state file `Mode` is the authoritative source. A fresh invocation without a flag inherits the stored mode; a fresh invocation with an explicit flag **overrides** the stored mode and rewrites it. This lets the user downgrade an `auto` run to `default` by re-invoking the skill, but does not silently demote an autonomous run just because the wake-up prompt was edited.

---

## Phase 2: Round loop

One round = one full pass of Phases 2.1 → 2.5. After 2.5, either merge (Phase 5) or sleep (Phase 4) and start a new round.

Each round begins by re-fetching PR state. Nothing is cached across rounds except the state file.

### 2.1 Sync PR state

```bash
# GitHub — single call covers CI rollup, reviews decision, mergeability
PR_STATE=$(gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,\
isDraft,state,reviews,reviewRequests)
```

Classify:

| PR attribute | Values that matter |
|---|---|
| `state` | OPEN → continue; MERGED / CLOSED → Phase 5 terminal |
| `isDraft` | `true` → handle review comments and CI, but never enter Phase 5; surface to user with "PR is draft — promote to ready with `gh pr ready` or abort" when everything else would be merge-ready |
| `statusCheckRollup` | Any `FAILURE` / `CANCELLED` / `TIMED_OUT` → 2.2 CI handling; all `SUCCESS` → skip 2.2; mix of `IN_PROGRESS` + no failures → wait (Phase 4) |
| `reviewDecision` | `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → 2.3 must run; `APPROVED` → candidate for merge; `REVIEW_REQUIRED` → 2.4 (request review) |
| `mergeable` + `mergeStateStatus` | `CONFLICTING` → 2.6 rebase; `BLOCKED` (missing approval, failing required check) → identify and loop |

### 2.2 CI handling

For each failed check:

1. Download the job log (GitHub: `gh run view --log-failed <run-id>`; GitLab: `glab ci trace`).
2. Classify the failure:
   - Test failure → symptom + failing test path.
   - Build failure → file + error.
   - Lint / format → specific rule.
   - Infra / runner / network error → retryable without code change.
3. Render a **CI failure table** in session:

   ```
   | Check | Failure | Likely cause | Proposed action | Delegate |
   |-------|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
   | build | unresolved reference: Foo | renamed class, import stale | update import at <file:line> | implement |
   | test  | ExpectedFooTest.bar assert | behaviour change in diff | review diff vs test expectation | debug |
   | lint  | ktlint wrapping            | auto-fixable               | run `ktlint --format` | implement |
   | e2e   | network timeout            | flake                      | retry once                | — |
   ```
4. Retry infra flakes once automatically (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`). Do not retry actual failures.
5. For code-fix rows — delegate per the **Delegation protocol** (§ Phase 3).
6. After fixes land: push, re-enter Phase 2.1.

**Failure-loop guard.** If the same check name fails 3 rounds in a row with no new commit diagnosis (same error signature), stop and surface as a blocker. Record it in state file's `Blockers raised` and ask the user what to do.

### 2.3 Review handling

Fetch all comments and thread state:

```bash
# GitHub — inline review comments (line-attached)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, in_reply_to_id, user:.user.login, path, line, body, created_at}]'

# GitHub — review summaries (top-level)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, user:.user.login, state, body, submitted_at}]'

# GitHub — PR-level issue comments
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, user:.user.login, body, created_at}]'

# GitHub — review threads (for isResolved + node ids used when replying + resolving)
# Paginate 100 per page until hasNextPage == false; accumulate to a temp file
```

For GitLab use `glab api "/projects/$PROJECT/merge_requests/$MR_IID/discussions"` which returns resolution state inline.

Fetch diff:

```bash
git diff "origin/$BASE"...HEAD
```

Filter before categorizing:

- Skip replies in already-resolved threads.
- Skip the skill's own earlier replies — identify by `(author == principal) AND (comment id OR body signature matches a state file `Commitments` row with `replied: true`)`. Do NOT skip every comment from the principal unconditionally — the user may also post from the same account, and those comments must be treated as reviewer input.
- Skip comments already covered by a row in state file `Commitments` with `replied: true`.

#### Categorize each remaining item

Category (one of):

| Category | When |
|---|---|
| `BLOCKING` | Security vuln, correctness bug on main path, crash, data loss risk, compliance violation, inaccurate data in regulated/audit/financial pipelines |
| `IMPORTANT` | Non-critical bug, missing error handling, logic error, edge-case miss, missing test for a broken case |
| `SUGGESTION` | Refactor, alternative approach, architectural improvement — no correctness risk if left as-is |
| `NIT` | Naming, formatting, style with no functional impact |
| `QUESTION` | Reviewer asks for clarification — may or may not imply a change |
| `PRAISE` | Approval, compliment |
| `OUT_OF_SCOPE` | Valid but belongs in a different PR or issue |

Actionability (one of):

| Actionability | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FIXABLE` | Clear what to change; can be handed off as-is |
| `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` | Ambiguous comment — must ask reviewer before acting |
| `DISCUSSION` | No single right answer — needs user decision |
| `NO_ACTION` | Already fixed, duplicate, invalid, praise |

Priority (derived, used for ordering in the decision table):

- `P0` = BLOCKING + FIXABLE
- `P1` = IMPORTANT + FIXABLE
- `P2` = SUGGESTION + FIXABLE, or any category + NEEDS_CLARIFICATION on a P0/P1 item
- `P3` = NIT + FIXABLE, SUGGESTION + DISCUSSION
- `P4` = PRAISE, OUT_OF_SCOPE, NO_ACTION

#### Verify the suggestion against the diff

For every BLOCKING / IMPORTANT + FIXABLE item:

1. Is the suggestion correct for this codebase's patterns?
2. Would it break tests that currently pass?
3. Is there a comment / ADR / commit message explaining why the current form exists?
4. Does it apply to all platforms/versions this PR targets?

If any check fails → keep the category but change actionability to `DISCUSSION`, record a short note explaining what's wrong with the suggestion.

#### Pattern match across the diff

For every concrete code pattern mentioned (missing null check, deprecated API, hardcoded string, etc.) — search the rest of the diff for the same shape. Additional locations become part of the same item, not separate ones.

#### Group and dedup

Multiple reviewers pointing at the same issue → one group. Multiple comments from one reviewer covering concerns one fix addresses → one group.

#### Propose a concrete solution per actionable item

For each FIXABLE item, generate a specific proposal — not a category label. The proposal is one of:

- **Edit:** `<file:line>` with before/after snippet (≤15 lines total). Shown inline in the decision table row.
- **Delegate with intent:** a one-paragraph instruction naming the engineer (kotlin-engineer / swift-engineer / …) or skill (`implement` / `debug`) and the exact files to touch, when the change is too big for a snippet.
- **Ask in thread:** the clarifying question the skill will post, verbatim. Used for NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.
- **Dismiss with reply:** the canned template with a 1-sentence context slot, for PRAISE / OUT_OF_SCOPE / NO_ACTION / NIT+NO_ACTION.

Never output only a category without a proposal. The value of this skill is the proposal.

### 2.4 Decision table (the gate)

Render in session as a **prioritized list**, not a table. One section per priority bucket present in the round, ordered most critical first. Each item is one short paragraph: bold headline = the gist; then prose with author, location, brief context, and the action — no bullet labels, no `→` arrows, no `Reviewer:` / `Action:` / `Verdict:` fields. Reads like a human issue note, not a form.

```
Round N — review proposals

## P0 — Blocking

1. **Crash: userId is nullable, used as non-null on .length.** @alice, api/User.kt:42.
   Reproducible from the diff. Guard with a safe call:

       - val length = userId.length
       + val length = userId?.length ?: 0

## P1 — Important

2. **Flow.collect leaks without a cancellation guard on rotate.** @bob,
   api/Repo.kt:88 (same pattern at :120). Delegate to `implement`: переписать
   оба места на `repeatOnLifecycle(STARTED)`, ничего больше не трогать.

## P2 — Suggestion

3. **Уточнить scope для v1 vs v2.** @bob, api/Repo.kt:91. Ревьюер спросил, нужно
   ли это для initial release. Ответить в треде: "Targeting v2 — opening a
   follow-up issue. Does that work?"

## P3 — Nit

4. **Локальная переменная `tmp` непонятна.** @alice, ui/Screen.kt:12.
   Переименовать `tmp` → `pendingUser`.

## P4 — Praise / Out-of-scope / NoAction

5. **PRAISE.** @alice. Reply: "Thanks — appreciated." Резолв.

6. **OUT_OF_SCOPE.** @carol, api/Repo.kt:200. Reply: "Valid concern, out of scope
   for this PR. Follow-up issue если скажешь." Резолв.

## Blockers

нет.

## Summary

6 пунктов: 2 правки, 1 делегирование, 2 dismiss, 1 уточнение.
```

**Format rules:**

- Sections in order P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4. Skip empty buckets.
- Numbering is **continuous** across sections (1, 2, 3 …) — gate-команды (`approve`, `skip 1,4`, `stop`) ссылаются на эти номера.
- Each item: `**Bold headline.**` (one sentence про суть) + `@author, file:line.` + 1–2 sentences context and action. Snippet inline indented when relevant (≤15 lines).
- Quote the reviewer verbatim only when paraphrase loses meaning. Иначе перевести в суть и пропустить кавычки.
- No labels, no `→`, no category/actionability/delegate columns — приоритет уже сказан секцией; что делать — последним предложением.
- `## Blockers` section всегда выводится последней (одно слово «нет.» если пусто) — это то, что останавливает раунд для пользователя.
- `## Summary` — одна строка с разбивкой по типам действий.

**Gate behaviour:**

- Default mode: stop here. Tell the user: `reply "approve" to execute all items, "skip 1,4" (or "skip 1 4") to drop items by number, or "stop" to end the round without acting.` Wait for input. Accept both comma-separated and space-separated number lists; strip whitespace around commas. Numbering is global and continuous across sections — no letters, no per-section restart.
- `--auto`: skip waiting; proceed to Phase 3.
- `--dry-run`: print the list and stop for good.

Blockers are always surfaced — `--auto` does not swallow them. If any P0 item is DISCUSSION, stop and ask regardless of mode.

### 2.5 Round outcome

After Phase 3 executes the approved rows: push, update state file (append a row to `Rounds` and to `Commitments`), decide next step:

| Situation | Next |
|---|---|
| New fixes pushed → CI will run → wait for it | Phase 4 poll |
| No code changes, only dismisses/replies posted, review still pending | Phase 4 poll (wait for reviewer) |
| All threads closed, CI green, `reviewDecision == APPROVED`, mergeable | Phase 5 merge |
| `mergeStateStatus == BEHIND` (base moved) | Phase 2.6 rebase, then poll |
| Blocker raised | Stop, update state file, surface to user |

### 2.6 Rebase when base has advanced

When `mergeStateStatus` is `BEHIND` / `OUT_OF_DATE`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase "origin/$BASE"
```

On clean rebase: run local `check` skill (build + lint + tests); on success push with `--force-with-lease`. On conflict: resolve only truly mechanical conflicts (import reshuffle, unrelated whitespace); otherwise surface as a blocker — do not guess merge resolutions that involve logic.

**Expected side effect.** After a `--force-with-lease` push, some repos reset `reviewDecision` from `APPROVED` back to `REVIEW_REQUIRED` (branch-protection "Dismiss stale approvals" setting). Do not treat this as a regression — re-request review per Phase 3.6 and keep looping. Tracking commit sha in `Commitments.fix_commit_sha` identifies which fixes have already been through review versus which are new since the rebase.

---

## Phase 3: Execute approved rows

Execute strictly in table order. Record each row's outcome inline in the session as it runs.

### 3.1 Edit rows

Apply the snippet directly via Edit tool (one file at a time). After all edit rows: run `check` skill (build + lint + tests). If `check` fails, roll the loop to Phase 2.2 with the new errors — do not push broken code.

### 3.2 Delegate rows

For each delegate row: invoke the named skill (`implement` or `debug`) or engineer agent via the Task tool. Prompt includes:

- The reviewer comment quote.
- The proposed approach from the decision table.
- The files to touch.
- Scope guard: "Touch only the listed files. No new tests, no CI / workflow / build-config edits, no doc rewrites, no dependency changes, no refactors outside the listed files. Report back with a diff summary."

Delegates run sequentially, not in parallel, so their edits don't stomp each other. After each delegate returns — spot-check the diff; if it touched anything outside the listed files (including `.github/`, tests directories not mentioned, `package.json` / `build.gradle`, docs), revert and surface as a blocker.

### 3.3 Ask-in-thread rows (NEEDS_CLARIFICATION)

Post the verbatim question as a reply in the thread. Do not resolve. Record in state file `Commitments` with `replied: true, resolved: false`.

### 3.4 Dismiss rows (terminal verdicts)

For PRAISE / OUT_OF_SCOPE / NO_ACTION / NIT+NO_ACTION:

1. Post reply using the canned template + sanitized 1-sentence slot.
2. Resolve the thread.
3. Record in state file `Commitments` with `replied: true, resolved: true`.

**Reply delivery — safety rules:**

- Body always piped through `jq -n --arg b ... --argjson r ...` into `gh api --input -`. Never `-f body="$TEXT"`.
- Rate-limit handling: on `403` / `429`, inspect `x-ratelimit-remaining`, `x-ratelimit-reset`, and `retry-after`. **Primary rate limit** (`x-ratelimit-remaining: 0`) — schedule a `ScheduleWakeup` at `x-ratelimit-reset` (UTC epoch) and exit the round. **Secondary rate limit / abuse detection** (`retry-after: N`) — sleep `N + 5` seconds locally and retry once; if it fails again, surface as a blocker. Never burn the round in a tight retry loop.
- Sanitize slot: NFKC normalize → strip BiDi + format chars → strip HTML → strip shell metacharacters (`` ` ``, `$(`, `${`) → collapse newlines → neutralize `@mention` (remove `@`) and cross-refs (`#123` → `issue-123`) → clamp to 120 chars. Empty after sanitize → drop the slot, use template without it.
- Cap total reply body at 280 chars.
- Pre-POST thread-ownership verify: GraphQL node query → `pullRequest.number` matches + `repository.id` matches header `Repository node id` from state file. Mismatch → skip this row, log `integrity_mismatch`, abort the round (do not continue POSTing other rows).
- Pre-POST race check: if the thread was resolved by someone else since Phase 2.3 fetch, skip (record `already_resolved`).

### 3.5 Commit + push

After code-change rows (edit + delegate): one commit per logical group of reviewer items. Commit message: `Address review: <short summary>`. Push: plain `git push` for fast-forward additions; `git push --force-with-lease` only when history was rewritten (rebase, amend, fixup squash). Plain `--force` is forbidden.

### 3.6 Re-request review after code changes

If any BLOCKING / IMPORTANT row actually changed code — re-request review from all reviewers whose `state` was `CHANGES_REQUESTED` in the current round snapshot.

```bash
# GitHub: request a re-review from a specific user
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO_NAME/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/requested_reviewers" \
  -X POST -F "reviewers[]=<login>"

# Copilot bot — the login is "copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]".
# Resolve its node id from the PR's suggestedReviewers / past reviewer pool:
COPILOT_NODE_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$pr:Int!){
    repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){
      pullRequest(number:$pr){
        suggestedReviewers { reviewer { login ... on Bot { id } ... on User { id } } }
        reviews(first:50) { nodes { author { login ... on Bot { id } ... on User { id } } } }
      }
    }
  }' -F owner="$OWNER" -F repo="$REPO_NAME" -F pr="$PR_NUMBER" \
  | jq -r '[.data.repository.pullRequest.suggestedReviewers[].reviewer,
            .data.repository.pullRequest.reviews.nodes[].author]
           | map(select(.login=="copilot-pull-request-reviewer"))[0].id // empty')

# Best-effort. If empty — Copilot is not part of this repo's review pool, skip silently.
if [ -n "$COPILOT_NODE_ID" ]; then
  MUTATION_OUT=$(gh api graphql -f query='
    mutation($pr:ID!,$user:ID!){
      requestReviews(input:{pullRequestId:$pr, userIds:[$user]}){
        pullRequest { id }
      }
    }' -f pr="$PR_NODE_ID" -f user="$COPILOT_NODE_ID" 2>&1)
  # Explicit error check — a bot no longer in the review pool returns an `errors` array,
  # not a non-zero exit code. Without this check the failure is silent.
  if jq -e '.errors // empty' <<<"$MUTATION_OUT" >/dev/null 2>&1 || [ -z "$MUTATION_OUT" ]; then
    # Record once, stop trying for the rest of this PR's lifetime.
    # Downgrade state-file header field `Copilot node id:` to the sentinel `unavailable`.
    COPILOT_NODE_ID=""
  fi
fi
```

Cache `$COPILOT_NODE_ID` in the state file header once resolved (avoid re-querying every round). If the lookup returned empty or the mutation returned `errors` — write the sentinel `Copilot node id: unavailable` into the header (the single schema-defined way to flag this; do NOT invent a separate `copilot_unavailable` field) and stop trying for the rest of this PR's lifetime.

GitLab: `glab mr update $MR_IID --reviewer <user>` for humans; GitLab has no first-class bot equivalent of Copilot review — skip.

---

## Phase 4: Poll (ScheduleWakeup)

When the round ended with "wait" (CI running or review pending) — schedule the next round. The wake-up prompt is built from the stored `Mode` in the state file (per "Mode precedence on resume" in Phase 1.4) — never hardcoded.

```
WAKEUP_PROMPT="/drive-to-merge"
[ "$STATE_MODE" = "auto" ] && WAKEUP_PROMPT="/drive-to-merge --auto"
# dry-run never reaches Phase 4 — it exits after the first decision table.

ScheduleWakeup(
  delaySeconds: <picked>,
  reason:       "drive-to-merge poll: <what we're waiting on>",
  prompt:       $WAKEUP_PROMPT
)
```

Pick `delaySeconds`:

| Waiting on | delaySeconds |
|---|---|
| CI in progress, fast pipeline known (<5 min) | 270 (stay in cache window) |
| CI in progress, slow pipeline (≥5 min) | 600–1200 |
| Copilot bot review after re-request | 270 (stay in cache window for the first check); if still pending, 600 |
| Human reviewer after re-request | 1800 (30 min) |
| Approved but `mergeStateStatus == BLOCKED` on an unknown reason | 900 |

Avoid the 280–550s range: past 270s the prompt cache TTL expires, but under ~600s the cache miss is not amortized. Pick either ≤270 (stay warm) or ≥600 (commit to a longer wait).

After 6 consecutive polls with no state change — stop, record in state file `Blockers raised`, surface to the user.

On wake-up: re-read the state file, re-enter Phase 2.1.

---

## Phase 5: Merge (always user-confirmed)

Entered when: CI all green + `reviewDecision == APPROVED` + no unresolved threads owned by this skill + `mergeable == MERGEABLE` + `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`.

Before proposing merge:

1. Re-verify the state file's `Commitments` section — every row with `delegated_to` must have non-empty `fix_commit_sha` and `replied: true`.
2. Re-pull PR state (reviewers may have changed their decision since last round).
3. Confirm the branch has not diverged from origin. If `git status -sb` shows the local branch behind / ahead of `origin/$HEAD` unexpectedly — skip merge, log the delta, return to Phase 2.1 for one more round.

Show the user:

```
PR ready to merge.

URL:     <PR URL>
Branch:  <head> → <base>
Commits: <N since branch point>
Final CI: ✔ all checks passing
Review:  ✔ approved by <reviewers>

Reply "merge" to execute, or supply a different method / message.
```

Wait for explicit user confirmation. `--auto` does NOT skip this gate — by design, final merge always requires explicit user approval.

On confirmation, re-verify state one last time before invoking merge — between the gate and the API call, CI may have failed or approval may have been dismissed:

```bash
FINAL=$(gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus)
# Abort merge if anything regressed since the gate; loop back to Phase 2.1.
```

If the re-check is still green:

```bash
gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --<method> --subject "<subject>" --body "<body>" --delete-branch
# GitLab
glab mr merge "$MR_IID" --<method-flag> --delete-source-branch
```

After merge:

1. Mark state file `Status: merged`, timestamp the `Rounds` final entry.
2. Report the merged URL + commit sha to the user.
3. Stop. No further polling.

## Terminal states

| State | When | What the skill writes |
|---|---|---|
| `merged` | Phase 5 succeeded | state file marked merged, success summary in session |
| `blocked` | A blocker was surfaced (failure-loop guard, integrity mismatch, unresolvable rebase, DISCUSSION requires user, polling exceeded cap, or user explicitly says "stop") | state file `Blockers raised` filled (including reason `"user stop"` when applicable), session message explains next action |

## Defaults for autonomous judgement

The skill decides these without asking, in any mode:

- **NEEDS_CLARIFICATION** — ask the clarifying question in the thread; record and move on. Do not stop the round.
- **OUT_OF_SCOPE** — dismiss with reply. Offer (in the decision table row) to create a follow-up issue; create it only if the user types "create issues" during the approval step.
- **NIT + FIXABLE** — include in the edits batch. Trivial renames and formatting are worth the round.
- **DISCUSSION on P0/P1** — stop, surface as blocker. Never execute guesses on blocking-level disagreements.
- **DISCUSSION on P2/P3** — include as a table row with proposal "ack-in-thread-without-code-change"; a short reply summarizing the skill's counter-view and leaving the thread open for the reviewer.

---

## Principles

**One skill, one loop.** CI, review, rebase, merge — all one loop with shared state. Never hand off mid-round to another skill for orchestration; delegate individual edits, but own the loop.

**All output in the session.** The decision table, proposals, blockers, final merge summary — all rendered as chat messages. The state file is for resumption after compaction, not for user editing.

**Proposals are concrete.** Every actionable row carries a snippet, a delegation instruction, or the exact question text. "BLOCKING / FIXABLE" alone is not a proposal.

**Autonomous by default.** The user should only see decisions that require judgement: true disagreements, unresolvable rebases, final merge. Everything mechanical happens without asking.

**Approval gate ≠ merge gate.** `--auto` removes the round-level approval gate. It does not remove the merge gate — by design, final merge always requires explicit user confirmation.

**Safe by construction.** Replies go through the sanitize pipeline; thread ownership is re-verified before every POST; POST bodies go through stdin, never shell args; force-push uses `--force-with-lease` only.

**Respect the reviewer.** Push back on wrong suggestions (record as DISCUSSION, draft a counter-reply); do not dress a broken suggestion up as FIXABLE and ship the broken fix.

**Pattern completeness.** Fixing one reported instance while identical problems remain elsewhere in the diff gets the thread reopened. Pattern-match at analysis time, fix at apply time.

**Fail loudly, not silently.** Three CI failures on the same signature, an integrity mismatch, a rebase with logic conflicts — stop and surface, do not retry forever.

## Tool priority

`gh` / `glab` CLI when available → REST via `gh api` / `glab api` → GraphQL via `gh api graphql` for review threads and node ids → `ScheduleWakeup` for Phase 4 polling → nothing else.

If neither `gh` nor `glab` is installed or authenticated, stop with a clear message: this skill cannot degrade gracefully without a working CLI, because its value is autonomous push + reply + resolve. Ask the user to install and authenticate, then rerun.

`ScheduleWakeup` is required for autonomous polling. If the runtime does not expose it, fall back to a single-shot round: report state, record a "wake me manually" note in the state file, and exit. The user then re-invokes `/drive-to-merge` when they want the next round.
