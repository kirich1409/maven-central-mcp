  This skill should be used when the user asks to "prepare for PR", "clean up before review",
  "quality check the branch", "run the quality loop", "check before PR", "make it PR-ready",
  or when implementation is complete and the branch needs quality-checking before creating a PR.
  Runs build, simplify, self-review, intent verification, optional expert reviews, and lint/tests
  in a loop until only minor or no issues remain.

# Prepare for PR

## Overview

Runs a quality loop over the current branch changes until the code is clean enough to expose in a PR.

**Core principle:** Fix only what belongs to current changes. Out-of-scope issues with an obvious fix can be handled autonomously; otherwise ask the user.

## Iteration Limits

- **Per gate:** if a single gate (build, lint, self-review, etc.) fails 3 consecutive fix attempts, stop fixing and escalate to the user with a summary of what was tried.
- **Total loop:** maximum 5 full loop iterations. If issues persist after 5 iterations, stop and produce the quality report with status `partial` — further iteration is unlikely to converge.

## Setup

Before the loop, establish the diff base and build tooling:

```bash
# Determine base branch
BASE=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep "HEAD branch" | awk '{print $NF}')
# Fallback: try main → master → develop

# Current changes boundary (use throughout for scope decisions)
git diff $BASE...HEAD
```

**Build system detection — use highest-priority match when multiple files present:**

| Priority | File present | Build | Lint | Test |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Makefile` (with build/lint/test targets) | `make build` | `make lint` | `make test` |
| 2 | `package.json` | `npm run build` | `npm run lint` | `npm test` |
| 3 | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build` | `cargo clippy` | `cargo test` |
| 4 | `build.gradle(.kts)` | `./gradlew build` | `./gradlew lint` | `./gradlew test` |
| 5 | `pom.xml` | `mvn package -q` | `mvn checkstyle:check` | `mvn test` |
| 6 | `go.mod` | `go build ./...` | `golangci-lint run` | `go test ./...` |
| 7 | `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | `pip install -e .` | `ruff check .` | `pytest` |

**Monorepo / subdirectory projects:** if all changed files are under a single subdirectory that has its own build file, prefer that subdirectory's build system over the root. Example: all changes under `plugins/maven-mcp/` which has its own `package.json` → run `npm` commands from that subdirectory, not a root `Makefile`.

## Quality Loop

**Track all issues found and their status (open / fixed / deferred) across iterations.** On re-entry, only report NEW issues. Deferred issues are removed from the fix queue — never re-prompted.

**Stage and commit fixes as you make them** during the loop, grouping related changes together (use specific file paths, not `git add .`). This allows logical commit grouping without having to reconstruct it at the end.

**Simplify runs only on the first iteration.** Self-review and lint/tests run every iteration.

```dot
digraph prepare_for_pr {
    rankdir=TB;

    start [label="Implementation complete", shape=doublecircle];
    setup [label="Detect base branch + build system", shape=box];
    build [label="Build", shape=box];
    build_pass [label="Passes?", shape=diamond];
    scope_build [label="Scope decision\n(see below)", shape=box];
    simplify [label="Simplify\n[1st iteration only]", shape=box];

    intent_pass -> scope_issues [label="no — drift found"];
    expert -> new_issues;

    scope_issues -> assess [label="user defers\n(mark deferred, continue)"];
    assess -> fix [label="yes — non-deferred\nnon-minor remain"];
    assess -> commit [label="no"];
    commit -> report -> done;
}
```

## Scope Decision

```dot
digraph scope {
    rankdir=LR;

    check [label="In current changes\n(git diff $BASE...HEAD)?", shape=diamond];
    obvious [label="Fix is obvious?", shape=diamond];
    auto [label="Fix autonomously", shape=box];
    ask [label="Ask user\n(issue + reason + options)", shape=box];
    user_fix [label="User: fix here", shape=box];
    user_defer [label="User: defer/skip\n(mark deferred)", shape=box];

    check -> auto [label="yes"];
    check -> obvious [label="no"];
    obvious -> auto [label="yes"];
    obvious -> ask [label="no"];
    ask -> user_fix -> auto;
    ask -> user_defer;
}
```

**In scope — fix autonomously:** bugs introduced by current changes, tests broken by current changes, lint errors in changed files, logic/security errors in current implementation.

**Out of scope, obvious fix:** missing import clearly needed by new code, typo in a newly added string, test fixture update required by a changed function signature.

**Out of scope, ask user:** pre-existing failures in untouched files, build errors from unrelated dependency changes, failures in files not touched by this branch. When asking, include: what the issue is, why it appears unrelated, and options (fix here / skip / open separate issue). Pause until user responds.

## Simplify

Review all changed code (`git diff $BASE...HEAD`) for unnecessary complexity, duplication, and unclear naming. Simplify where possible without changing behavior:
- Remove dead code, unused imports, unreachable branches introduced by current changes
- Extract duplicated logic into shared functions
- Simplify overly nested conditionals or verbose patterns
- Rename unclear variables/functions to express intent
- Replace manual implementations with standard library equivalents where obvious

Fix issues inline, stage and commit. If no simplification opportunities — proceed to self-review.

## Self-Review Criteria

Run `git diff $BASE...HEAD` and check for:
- Logic errors or off-by-one mistakes
- Missing error handling for new code paths
- Security issues (exposed secrets, injection risks, missing validation)
- Missing or insufficient tests for new behavior
- Dead code or unreachable branches introduced

## Intent Verification

**Runs after lint/tests pass.** This is a semantic self-review that checks whether the code actually solves the stated problem — not just whether it compiles and passes tests.

**This review MUST be done by a DIFFERENT agent** than the one that wrote the code. Launch a fresh Explore agent for this step. The implementor reviewing their own work has blind spots — a separate agent catches intent drift, scope creep, and missed acceptance criteria.

### Procedure

The Explore agent receives this prompt:

```
You are performing an intent verification review. Your job is to compare what was
ASKED for against what was BUILT — checking for alignment, scope creep, and
completeness.

## Original Task
{task description from conversation context or swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md}

## Changes
{output of: git diff $BASE...HEAD}

## Checks

Answer each question with PASS, WARN, or FAIL and a 1-2 sentence explanation:

1. **Solves the stated problem?** — Does the code address the core ask?
2. **Scope creep?** — Are there changes unrelated to the task? List any files or
   functions that seem outside the original scope.
3. **Acceptance criteria met?** — If the plan has acceptance criteria, check each
   one. If no explicit criteria, assess whether reasonable implicit criteria are met.
4. **Intent drift?** — Has the approach diverged from what was planned? Is the
   divergence justified (e.g., discovered a better approach) or accidental?
5. **Missing pieces?** — Is anything from the task description NOT addressed in
   the code?

## Output

### Verdict: {PASS | WARN | FAIL}

### Details
{Answers to each check above}

### Issues (if WARN or FAIL)
- {issue description} — {suggestion}
```

### Handling the Result

- **PASS** — proceed to expert reviews (if applicable) or finish.
- **WARN** — present warnings to the user. If warnings are about scope creep, ask whether to revert or keep. If about missing pieces, fix them.
- **FAIL** — treat as non-minor issues. Enter the fix cycle. After fixing, re-run intent verification (counts toward the per-gate 3-attempt limit).

### Locating the Task Description

Check these sources in order:
1. `swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md` — if a plan exists, use its goal and acceptance criteria
2. Conversation context — the original user request
3. PR description (if a draft PR exists) — `gh pr view --json body`
4. If none found — skip intent verification and log a warning in the quality report

## Expert Reviews (Optional)

After intent verification passes, optionally trigger parallel expert reviews based on what files changed. These are NOT mandatory for every PR — only when changes touch areas that benefit from specialist attention.

### Trigger Rules

Analyze the diff (`git diff $BASE...HEAD --name-only` and content) to determine which experts to invoke:

| Expert | Trigger condition |
|--------|-------------------|
| `security-expert` | Changes touch: auth/login/session logic, crypto/hashing, token handling, network/API calls, user data processing, permission checks, input validation, secrets/env files |
| `performance-expert` | Changes touch: list/collection processing (RecyclerView, LazyColumn, large loops), DB queries/Room/SQLDelight, image loading/caching, hot paths (called per-frame or per-item), serialization/deserialization of large payloads |
| `architecture-expert` | Changes: add new modules/packages, modify dependency direction between layers, change public API surfaces (new public classes/interfaces), introduce new architectural patterns |

**If no triggers match — skip expert reviews entirely.** Most single-file bugfixes and small changes need no expert review.

### Expert Review Prompt

Each expert receives:

```
You are reviewing code changes as a {expert_role} expert.

## Changes
{git diff $BASE...HEAD — filtered to relevant files if possible}

## Focus
Review ONLY from your area of expertise. Do not comment on general code quality,
naming, or style — other steps handle that.

## Output Format
### Issues
For each issue:
**Issue N: {title}**
- **severity**: critical | major | minor
- **issue**: {description}
- **suggestion**: {fix}

If no issues found in your domain, respond with:
### No issues found
{1 sentence confirming what you checked}
```

### Handling Expert Results

- **Critical issues** — treat as non-minor, enter fix cycle
- **Major issues** — present to user, fix if in scope
- **Minor issues** — include in quality report as suggestions, do not block
- **No issues** — note in quality report that expert review passed

Experts run in parallel. Wait for all to complete before proceeding.

## Quality Report

At the end of the quality loop (whether exiting clean or hitting the iteration cap), save a summary to `swarm-report/<slug>-quality.md`:

```markdown
# Quality Report: {slug}

**Branch:** {branch name}
**Base:** {base branch}
**Status:** {clean | partial | escalated}
**Iterations:** {N} of 5

## Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Issues Found | Fixed | Deferred |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Build | PASS/FAIL | ... | ... | ... |
| Simplify | PASS/SKIP | ... | ... | — |
| Self-review | PASS/WARN | ... | ... | ... |
| Lint + Tests | PASS/FAIL | ... | ... | ... |
| Intent Verification | PASS/WARN/FAIL/SKIP | ... | ... | ... |
| Expert: security | PASS/SKIP/N-issues | ... | ... | ... |
| Expert: performance | PASS/SKIP/N-issues | ... | ... | ... |
| Expert: architecture | PASS/SKIP/N-issues | ... | ... | ... |

## Deferred Issues
{list of deferred issues with reasons, or "None"}

## Suggestions
{minor issues and expert suggestions not blocking the PR}
```

The quality report artifact serves as the receipt for the Quality stage in the dev-workflow state machine (see `dev-workflow-orchestration.md`).

## What "Minor" Means

**Minor (exit loop):** style preferences, optional naming improvements, cosmetic suggestions with no correctness impact.

**Non-minor (keep looping):** bugs, broken tests, lint errors, security issues, incorrect logic, missing required tests.

## Output

Display a summary to the user and save the full quality report artifact:

```markdown
## Quality Loop Result

| Step | Issues found | Fixed | Deferred |
|------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Build | ... | ... | ... |
| Simplify | ... | ... | — |
| Self-review | ... | ... | ... |
| Lint + Tests | ... | ... | ... |
| Intent Verification | ... | ... | ... |
| Expert Reviews | ... | ... | ... |

**Quality loop complete.** [If deferred items exist: X items deferred — see above.]
```

Full quality report saved to `swarm-report/<slug>-quality.md` (see Quality Report section above).
