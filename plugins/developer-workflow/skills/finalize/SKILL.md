name: finalize
description: >
  Code-quality pass over the current branch changes. Runs multi-round review-and-fix loop:
  code-reviewer (plan conformance, CLAUDE.md, bugs) → /simplify (reuse, quality, efficiency) →
  pr-review-toolkit agents (test quality, silent failures, type design) → conditional expert
  reviews (security, performance, architecture). Between each fix and each phase the /check
  skill verifies the code still builds, lints, and tests pass. Exits PASS when no BLOCK-level
  findings remain (WARN and NIT items are surfaced in the report but do not block), or
  ESCALATE after 3 rounds. Does NOT verify functional correctness — that's
  acceptance. Does NOT verify plan conformance at a logic level — that's handled by
  code-reviewer in Phase A. Invoke when the user says "finalize", "run code quality pass",
  "clean up the code", "prepare for review", "доведи код", "почисти", or when an orchestrator
  (feature-flow, bugfix-flow) runs this stage between implement and acceptance.

# Finalize

Code-quality pass between implement and acceptance. Multi-round review-and-fix loop focused on **how** the code is written (quality, clarity, robustness), not **what** it does (that's acceptance) or **whether it works** (that's implement + `/check`).

This skill exists because agent-written code carries recurring patterns worth polishing: over-engineered abstractions, silent failures in catch blocks, weak test coverage, fragile type designs, redundant utilities. `/check` doesn't catch these; `code-reviewer` alone is too narrow; `/simplify` alone is too narrow. `finalize` orchestrates the whole pass.

---

## Three quality layers — where `finalize` fits

| Stage | Answers | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| `implement` | Does the code work and match the plan? | build/lint/tests via `/check`, intent check |
| **`finalize`** | Is the code written well? | this skill |
| `acceptance` | Does the feature solve the user's problem? | functional verification via `manual-tester` |

---

## Inputs

The caller (orchestrator or user) provides:
- **`slug`** — the task slug used for artifact naming
- **Branch state** — finalize reads the current branch; it does not switch branches
- **Context artifact path (optional)** — Phase A's `code-reviewer` anchor. Accepts either a feature plan (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md`) or, for bugfix-flow invocations, the debug artifact (`swarm-report/<slug>-debug.md`). Either works — `code-reviewer` treats whichever is provided as the "what was supposed to happen" document.
- **Tolerance flags (optional):**
  - `--allow-warn` — stop after 1 round even if WARN findings remain (default: still exit PASS on WARN-only, but keep iterating BLOCKs until resolved or round budget runs out)
  - `--skip-experts` — omit Phase D (rarely useful; experts auto-skip if no triggers match)

---

## Round structure

Each round runs four phases A → B → C → D sequentially. Between phases and after any auto-fix, invoke `/check` to confirm the build still works. Accumulate findings. At the end of the round, decide: exit, or continue to next round.

```
Round N:
  Phase A  → code-reviewer          → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Phase B  → /simplify (auto-fixes) → /check               → continue
  Phase C  → pr-review-toolkit trio (parallel) → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Phase D  → expert reviews (conditional, parallel) → fix BLOCK → /check → continue
  Round end: did any BLOCK remain unfixed?
    yes → go to round N+1 (max 3 rounds total)
    no  → exit with PASS
```

### Exit criteria

- **PASS (exit):** no BLOCK severity findings from any phase. WARN and NIT findings listed in the report but do not block.
- **ESCALATE (stop and report to caller):** after 3 rounds, BLOCK findings still present. Dump unresolved findings, caller decides whether to override or loop back to `implement`.

### Max round budget

`max_rounds = 3`. Total budget (per round: 4 phases + fixes + `/check` after each fix) can take non-trivial wall time on large diffs. If a project regularly hits round 3, the BLOCK threshold may be too strict for the project's conventions — tune Phase A's `code-reviewer` confidence threshold (see `developer-workflow-experts/agents/code-reviewer.md`).

---

## Phase A — Semantic review (code-reviewer)

Launch the `code-reviewer` agent (from `developer-workflow-experts`) with:
- Original task description (verbatim)
- Plan artifact path (`swarm-report/<slug>-plan.md`) if it exists
- `git diff` of all branch changes

The agent returns a structured verdict: PASS / WARN / FAIL with findings scored on the 0/25/50/75/100 confidence rubric. Only findings passing the reporting threshold surface.

### Handling findings

| Severity × confidence | Action |
|---|---|
| critical ≥ 75 | Fix immediately. After fix, re-run `/check`. If the fix does not converge, the finding stays BLOCK — the round ends without exiting PASS; counted against the 3-round budget. Do not silently downgrade a critical finding to "acknowledged risk". |
| major ≥ 75 | Fix if tractable. If fix requires refactoring beyond the diff scope → escalate to caller. Remains BLOCK until resolved or escalated. |
| minor ≥ 50 | Include in report as NIT. Don't fix automatically; caller/user decides. NIT never blocks PASS. |

If `code-reviewer` returns FAIL verdict → this phase has BLOCKs that must be addressed before continuing.

### Output

Summary of this phase's findings goes into the round's log.

---

## Phase B — Built-in simplification (`/simplify`)

Invoke the built-in Claude Code skill `/simplify`. It runs three parallel review agents (reuse, quality, efficiency) and **applies fixes directly** for the findings it considers real.

`/simplify` focuses on:
- **Reuse**: duplicated logic that should use an existing utility
- **Quality**: redundant state, parameter sprawl, copy-paste, leaky abstractions, stringly-typed code, unnecessary comments
- **Efficiency**: redundant work, missed concurrency, hot-path bloat, TOCTOU, memory leaks

Because `/simplify` is fix-oriented, do not pre-review its output — trust the built-in, then run `/check` to confirm the project still builds and tests pass.

### If `/check` fails after `/simplify`

Revert the simplify commits (or the last commit if unambiguously from `/simplify`), log the failure, continue to Phase C. Do not re-invoke `/simplify` in the same round — if it broke something once, it's likely to repeat.

---

## Phase C — PR review toolkit (parallel)

Invoke three agents from the `pr-review-toolkit` plugin in **parallel**:

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| `pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer` | Quality of tests added in the diff: are edge cases covered? Behavioral vs. implementation testing? |
| `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` | Empty catch blocks, swallowed errors, catches too broad, errors logged but not surfaced |
| `pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer` | Can invalid states be represented? Are invariants encoded in types? Missing nullability markers, unsafe unions |

Each agent returns findings graded by the same 0–100 confidence rubric used by our `code-reviewer` (the plugin is hard-dep'd via `plugin.json`; agents inherit the convention through prompt sharing).

### Handling Phase C findings

Apply fix-loop rules identical to Phase A:
- BLOCK (critical/major + confidence ≥ 75) → fix → `/check`
- WARN (minor ≥ 50) → report, don't auto-fix
- Below threshold → drop

Fixes for test-quality findings (e.g., "this test doesn't cover the failure path") may require writing new test code — delegate that to the appropriate engineer agent (`kotlin-engineer`, `swift-engineer`, etc.) with the finding as input.

---

## Phase D — Expert reviews (conditional, parallel)

Trigger experts only when the diff matches their domain. Launch the matching ones in **parallel**.

| Expert | Trigger — files touch any of: |
|---|---|
| `security-expert` | Auth, encryption, token/secret storage, network requests, permissions, user data handling, crypto libraries |
| `performance-expert` | RecyclerView / LazyColumn adapters, DB queries, image loading, coroutine dispatchers, hot loops, large collections, N+1 patterns |
| `architecture-expert` | New modules created, dependency direction changed, public API modified, new abstractions introduced |

No trigger matched → skip Phase D entirely for this round.

### Handling expert findings

Experts typically produce deeper, higher-risk findings. Apply the same severity × confidence gate, but with a lower bar for fix urgency:

- security + critical: **always fix** before continuing, even at confidence 50 (security rarely benefits from optimism)
- performance / architecture + critical at confidence ≥ 75: fix if local to the diff; escalate if requires broader rework

---

## Mechanical verification between phases

After **any** code modification within a round (Phase A fix, Phase B auto-fix, Phase C fix, Phase D fix), re-invoke `/check`. If `/check` returns FAIL:

1. Log which phase's fix introduced the failure.
2. Attempt a narrow repair (1 attempt max).
3. If still failing → revert the fix and keep the originating finding **as BLOCK** on the round's list — the finding is not resolved, so it counts against the round budget. Continue with the remaining phases of the round (they may still find other issues), but do not mark the reverted finding as "acknowledged risk" — that label is reserved for items the user knowingly accepts at the end.
4. If the round ends with any such unresolved BLOCK, go to the next round. If round 3 ends with unresolved BLOCKs, exit with ESCALATE.

Do not let `/check` failures cascade — a broken build blocks further review and creates noise. But also do not use "revert + continue" as a way to silently ship a BLOCK.

## Report

Save `swarm-report/<slug>-finalize.md` on exit (PASS or ESCALATE):

```markdown
# Finalize: <slug>

**Date:** <date>
**Rounds run:** N (of 3 max)
**Exit:** PASS | ESCALATE
**Escalation reason:** <only if ESCALATE>

## Rounds

### Round 1
- Phase A (code-reviewer): verdict, N findings (K BLOCK, M WARN, L NIT). Fixes applied: X.
- Phase B (/simplify): Y files changed, auto-fixed.
- Phase C (pr-review-toolkit): breakdown per agent.
- Phase D (experts): triggered: [security-expert, ...]; findings, fixes.
- `/check` after round: PASS | FAIL (reason)

### Round 2
...

## Remaining findings (not auto-fixed)

| Severity | Confidence | Category | Finding | Phase | File:Line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WARN | 60 | quality | Inconsistent error logging | A | src/foo/Bar.kt:142 |
| NIT  | 75 | consistency | Unused import of X in new file | B | ... |

## Acknowledged risks

Findings that were not fixed because fix was non-trivial and they do not block merge.
Reviewer should be aware of them.

## Scope rules

- **In scope:** reviewing and improving the quality of code *related to the current diff*. Delegating fixes to engineer agents. Invoking `/check` after each mutation.
- **Out of scope:** writing new features, changing task scope, verifying functional correctness (acceptance), architectural redesign (escalate — this is a new task).
- **Prefer** to keep fixes inside the files touched by `implement`. Minimal, necessary edits in adjacent files are allowed when a finding explicitly requires them — e.g., Phase C's `pr-test-analyzer` may demand adding tests in a sibling test file, and Phase B's `/simplify` may extract a duplicated helper into an existing utility module. In every such case, keep the edit narrowly scoped to what the finding requires.
- **Never** re-scope the task under the guise of "cleanup". If a finding points to a structural issue beyond narrow-fix reach → escalate, do not refactor.
- **Never** silently skip Phase A — `code-reviewer`'s plan-conformance check is the anchor. If the agent fails to launch for infrastructure reasons, stop and escalate.
- **Never** run forever. 3 rounds, then report.

---

## Escalation

Stop and report to caller when:

- After 3 rounds, BLOCK findings remain unresolved
- `/check` fails and the fix doesn't converge after 1 retry
- A BLOCK finding requires refactoring beyond the diff scope
- An expert finding demands architectural changes (new modules, dependency reorg)
- Required engineer agent (e.g., `kotlin-engineer`) is not installed but needed for a fix

When escalating: state which phase escalated, what the unresolved findings are, and what the caller needs to decide (accept risks, loop to implement with new task, architectural redesign, etc.).

---

## Integration notes

- **`feature-flow`** and **`bugfix-flow`** invoke this skill between `implement` and `acceptance`.
- **Manual invocation** is useful for: pre-PR cleanup on a branch that didn't come through an orchestrator, periodic quality audit on an old branch that wasn't finalized, review of a branch before marking draft PR ready (even though orchestrators already do this automatically).
- The skill assumes `code-reviewer` and `pr-review-toolkit` agents are installed. `code-reviewer` comes from `developer-workflow-experts` (sibling dependency). `pr-review-toolkit` comes from `claude-plugins-official` (hard dep in `plugin.json`).

---

## Dependencies this skill requires

- Hard deps (declared in `plugins/developer-workflow/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`):
  - `developer-workflow-experts` — for `code-reviewer`, `security-expert`, `performance-expert`, `architecture-expert`
  - `pr-review-toolkit` (marketplace: `claude-plugins-official`) — for `pr-test-analyzer`, `silent-failure-hunter`, `type-design-analyzer`
- Built-in skills:
  - `/simplify` — Claude Code's built-in reuse/quality/efficiency pass
  - `/check` — this plugin's mechanical verification utility
