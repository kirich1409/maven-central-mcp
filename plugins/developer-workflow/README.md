# developer-workflow

Claude Code plugin with skills for developer workflow habits — safe code migration, test plan generation, exploratory QA testing, feature verification, preparing branches for code review, and managing the full PR lifecycle.

## Skills

### `decompose-feature`

Breaks a feature idea, PRD, or epic into a structured task list with dependencies, acceptance criteria, complexity estimates, and implementation order:
- Accepts text, URLs, PRDs, or Figma links as input
- Launches parallel expert agents (codebase, architecture, business analyst) for context gathering
- Decomposes into tasks with IDs, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and complexity (S/M/L)
- Orders tasks into waves via topological sort by dependency graph
- Auto-reviews via business-analyst for completeness and scope creep
- Saves artifact to `swarm-report/<slug>-decomposition.md`

Use when breaking down a feature idea into implementable tasks before starting work.

### `feature-flow`

Thin orchestrator for features — routes through the full pipeline autonomously:
- research → decompose → plan review → [implement → acceptance] per task → PR → merge
- Strict state machine with explicit allowed transitions
- Stops at human review, PARTIAL verdict, and escalation points

See [detailed flow diagram](docs/ORCHESTRATORS.md#feature-flow-feature-flow).

### `bugfix-flow`

Thin orchestrator for bug fixes — routes through diagnosis to merge:
- debug → implement → acceptance → PR → merge
- Verifies bug no longer reproduces before PR
- Stops at human review and when bug is not reproducible

See [detailed flow diagram](docs/ORCHESTRATORS.md#bugfix-flow-bugfix-flow).

### `implement`

Standalone implementation stage — takes a task with optional context and produces working code:
- Accepts any task source: text, issue URL, or pipeline artifacts (`research.md`, `debug.md`, `plan.md`)
- Delegates code writing to specialist agents (`kotlin-engineer`, `compose-developer`, etc.)
- Runs `simplify` + quality loop (build → lint → tests → `code-reviewer` → expert reviews)
- Produces `implement.md` + `quality.md` artifacts for the next pipeline stage

Can be invoked by an orchestrator or directly by the user.

### `create-pr`

Creates a pull request or merge request for the current branch:
- Auto-generates title from branch name and commit history
- Produces a structured description from the diff
- Selects labels from the repo's existing label set
- Suggests reviewers from recent git history on changed files
- Supports GitHub and GitLab, draft or ready-for-review

### `code-migration`

Guides safe, verified technology migrations in Gradle/Android/Kotlin/KMP projects:
- Discovers what needs migrating by reading the target (file, class, directory, or module)
- Chooses the right strategy: **in-place** (small, well-tested targets) or **parallel** (many callers, large scope, module restructuring)
- Snapshots current behavior before touching any code (tests / screenshots / API checklist)
- Migrates with green builds at every step
- Verifies nothing changed; presents visual diffs to user for approval
- Cleans up old technology: dead code, unused Gradle deps, stale imports

Examples: Java Date → Kotlin Date, XML layouts → Jetpack Compose, data binding → view binding, RxJava → coroutines.

Use when migrating code from one technology to another within an existing project.

### `triage-feedback`

Analyzes feedback without acting on it. Works on two source types: an open PR/MR
(review comments, review summaries, PR-level comments) and user-provided text
pasted in the chat (bug reports, stacktraces, CI logs, free-form feedback).
Auto-detects the source; asks when ambiguous.

- Normalizes items from any source into a common shape
- Categorizes (BLOCKING / IMPORTANT / SUGGESTION / NIT / QUESTION / PRAISE / OUT_OF_SCOPE)
- Assesses actionability (FIXABLE / NEEDS_CLARIFICATION / DISCUSSION / NO_ACTION)
- Verifies suggestions against the diff; detects pattern matches in other locations
- Groups and dedups; writes a structured report to `swarm-report/<slug>-triage.md`

Never edits code, replies, resolves threads, or merges. The report is consumed
by the user or by downstream skills (`implement-task`, `debug`, `decompose-feature`).

### `kmp-migration`

Guides a full migration of an Android module to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):
- Assesses the module, confirms target platforms, checks Kotlin version and module isolation
- Audits every dependency for KMP compatibility using `maven-mcp` tools
- Walks through plugin setup, source set restructuring, and dependency splitting
- Covers iOS framework exposure (CocoaPods, SPM, direct XCFramework)
- Verifies all targets compile and tests pass; cleans up Android-only artifacts

Use when migrating a module to share code with iOS, JVM, or other platforms.

### `migrate-to-compose`

Guides View-to-Compose migration for Activities, Fragments, and custom Views:
- Maps View hierarchy to Compose equivalents (layouts, widgets, custom views)
- Discovers project Compose patterns (theme, state model, shared components) before writing code
- Delegates implementation to `compose-developer` agent with a structured migration brief
- Supports incremental migration via `ComposeView` bridge or full rewrite
- Verifies visual fidelity with before/after comparison

Use when migrating Android View-based UI to Jetpack Compose.

### `plan-review`

Multi-agent review of an implementation plan using the PoLL (Panel of LLM Evaluators) consensus protocol:
- Discovers available agents dynamically; presents a multi-select and runs only the agents you choose
- Aggregates verdicts: PASS (no blockers), CONDITIONAL (improvements needed), FAIL (blockers must be resolved)
- Produces a structured review report with per-reviewer findings and consensus summary

Use when you want an independent quality check on a plan before implementation.

### `research`

Structured investigation skill for exploring codebases, technologies, and approaches:
- Launches parallel research agents (codebase, web, docs, deps, architecture)
- Produces a consolidated research report with findings, recommendations, and open questions
- Can include web research for approaches and best practices when web search is available

Use for investigation tasks that don't require implementation — evaluations, comparisons, feasibility studies.

### `write-tests`

Orchestrates retroactive test generation for existing code that lacks coverage — discovers test infrastructure, plans test cases, delegates code generation to specialist agents:
- Accepts a file, class, module, or directory as target
- Discovers the project's test infrastructure (framework, assertions, mocking, naming conventions)
- Plans test cases for untested public API, edge cases, and error paths
- Delegates code generation to `kotlin-engineer` (or `compose-developer` for Compose UI)
- Verifies tests compile and pass; classifies failures as test bugs vs production bugs
- Reports coverage gains and any production bugs discovered (without fixing production code)

Consumes test plans from `generate-test-plan` when available, but works independently.

Use when adding tests to existing, untested code — not for tests as part of new feature development.

### `generate-test-plan`

Creates a structured, reusable test plan from a specification source without executing any tests:
- Accepts Figma mockups, PRDs, acceptance criteria, issues, or existing code as input
- Identifies risk areas, edge cases, and state combinations
- Writes prioritized test cases (P0–P3) across Smoke / Feature / Regression tiers
- Cross-references multiple spec sources and flags discrepancies
- Produces a `docs/testplans/<feature>-test-plan.md` ready for `manual-tester` or `acceptance`

Use when planning testing separately from execution — for review, reuse, or handoff.

### `acceptance`

Verifies a running application against a specification:
- Accepts a spec (Figma, PRD, acceptance criteria) and/or a test plan
- Ensures the app is running on device/simulator/browser
- Launches the `manual-tester` agent for full QA execution
- Produces a verification result: VERIFIED, FAILED, or PARTIAL
- Supports re-verification loops after bug fixes

Use after implementing a feature to confirm it matches the spec before PR.

### `bug-hunt`

Undirected bug hunting on a running app — no spec or test plan required:
- Explores screens guided by usability heuristics, error handling checks, and input edge cases
- Reports bugs (standard format with severity) and observations (non-bug UX findings)
- Produces a coverage map showing which screens were visited and what was checked
- Scope-bounded by screen count: Quick (~5), Standard (~15), or Deep (30+)
- Recommends next steps based on severity of findings

Use for pre-release QA sweeps, sanity checks, or finding issues specs don't anticipate.

## Agents

### User-Invokable Agents

These agents can be invoked directly by the user for specific tasks.

### `manual-tester`

Performs manual-style QA testing of a running mobile or web application:
- Connects to a real device, simulator, or browser; handles authentication before testing begins
- Writes structured test cases (Smoke / Feature / Regression tiers) from a spec, mockup, or PRD
- Executes every step as a real tool call via `mobile` MCP tools (native apps) or `playwright` MCP tools (web)
- Reports bugs with severity, reproduction steps, and screenshot evidence
- Runs a lightweight accessibility pass alongside functional tests
- Produces a Test Execution Summary with a ship/no-ship recommendation
- Supports re-test loops: re-executes failed cases after fixes and marks them VERIFIED or STILL FAILING

Use when you need a running app validated against a spec — or just exploratory smoke-tested.

### `code-reviewer`

Independent code reviewer for Quality Loop gate 4 (semantic self-review):
- Receives only task description, plan, and git diff — never the implementation conversation
- Reviews 5 dimensions: semantic correctness, logic errors, basic security, code quality, consistency
- Produces structured output with PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict
- Recommends specialist agents (security, performance, architecture) when findings exceed scope
- Read-only — cannot modify code, only report issues

Use when running the quality loop before PR, or when independent code review is needed.

### `compose-developer`

Writes production-ready Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform UI code:
- Implements screens from Figma mockups, screenshots, wireframes, or feature specs
- Discovers project Compose patterns (theme, state model, shared components) before writing code
- Follows modern best practices: Modifier.Node API, Slot API, stateless screen pattern, proper state hoisting
- Produces `@Preview` functions for every significant composable and distinct visual state
- Handles KMP targets — enforces `commonMain` import restrictions and Compose Multiplatform resource API
- Also used by the `migrate-to-compose` skill for View → Compose migration implementation

Use when you need Compose UI code written from a design, spec, or migration brief.

### `kotlin-engineer`

Writes production-ready Kotlin for Android and KMP client applications — business logic, data layer, and domain layer:
- Implements ViewModels, UseCases, Repositories, data sources, mappers, and DI wiring
- Discovers project architecture patterns (MVI, DI framework, error handling) before writing code
- Uses modern Kotlin: sealed interfaces, value classes, coroutines, Flow
- Follows Clean Architecture: domain models first, explicit layer boundaries, no DTOs in presentation
- Handles KMP targets — enforces `commonMain` import restrictions and `kotlinx.*` library choices
- Writes unit tests alongside implementation (fakes over mocks, Turbine for Flow testing)

Use when you need Kotlin feature code — everything except Compose UI (which goes to `compose-developer`).

### `swift-engineer`

Writes production-ready Swift for iOS and macOS applications — business logic, data layer, networking, models, repositories, and services:
- Implements services, repositories, data sources, models, and platform-specific code
- Discovers project architecture patterns before writing code
- Uses modern Swift: async/await, actors, Sendable, protocols, generics, value types
- Supports both standalone iOS/macOS projects and KMP platform-specific (`actual`) implementations
- Writes unit tests alongside implementation

Use when you need Swift feature code — everything except SwiftUI views (which goes to `swiftui-developer`).

### `swiftui-developer`

Writes production-ready SwiftUI UI code for iOS, macOS, and watchOS:
- Implements screens from Figma mockups, screenshots, wireframes, or feature specs
- Discovers project SwiftUI patterns (theme, state model, shared components) before writing code
- Follows modern best practices: MV pattern, @Observable, NavigationStack, .task {} for async work
- Produces `#Preview` blocks for every significant view and distinct visual state
- Full accessibility support: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type
- Also used by the `migrate-to-swiftui` skill for UIKit → SwiftUI migration implementation

Use when you need SwiftUI UI code written from a design, spec, or migration brief.

### Internal Expert Agents

These agents are invoked by skills and the quality loop orchestration — not meant for direct user invocation. They are selected automatically based on the task (e.g., what code was touched, what the plan covers).

### `architecture-expert`

Reviews and validates architectural decisions, module structure, and dependency direction:
- Evaluates module decomposition, layer boundaries, and API design between modules
- Validates plans and implementations against architectural best practices
- Analyzes dependency graphs for circular dependencies and incorrect direction
- Advises on when and how to extract modules or introduce abstractions

Use when a plan or implementation involves architectural decisions that need validation.

### `business-analyst`

Evaluates plans, features, and technical decisions from a product and business value perspective:
- Analyzes requirements for completeness, consistency, and implicit assumptions
- Scopes MVPs and prioritizes features by business value
- Formulates concrete acceptance criteria from vague requirements
- Performs trade-off analysis covering cost, time-to-market, and risk

Use when you need product-side evaluation of scope, requirements, or technical trade-offs.

### `security-expert`

Reviews code, architecture, and plans for security vulnerabilities:
- OWASP Top 10 analysis, data storage security, network security
- Authentication and authorization flow review
- CI/CD secrets management and mobile platform security
- Read-only — reports findings with severity and remediation guidance

Use when code touches auth, encryption, token storage, network requests, permissions, or user data.

### `performance-expert`

- Detects N+1 queries, memory leaks, threading problems, UI jank
- Reviews Compose recomposition scope, LazyList efficiency, network batching
- Checks coroutine dispatcher usage and potential coroutine leaks
- Read-only — reports findings with severity and optimization suggestions

Use when code touches RecyclerView/LazyColumn, database queries, image loading, hot loops, or large collections.

### `ux-expert`

Evaluates user experience, UI design decisions, and accessibility:
- Reviews user flows, navigation structure, and UI state handling
- Checks platform convention compliance (Material Design, HIG)
- Validates accessibility: contrast, touch targets, screen reader support
- Assesses error states, loading states, and empty states completeness

Use when implementing or reviewing screens, navigation, or user-facing features.

### `devops-expert`

Handles CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and release workflows:
- Diagnoses and optimizes CI/CD pipeline performance
- Configures release automation, artifact publishing, and environment management
- Sets up dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring
- Designs Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployment configurations

Use when working with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker, deployment, or release automation.

### `build-engineer`

Specializes in Gradle configuration, build performance, and multi-module project structure:
- Diagnoses and optimizes build performance (caching, parallelism, configuration avoidance)
- Configures AGP, KMP source sets, convention plugins, and version catalogs
- Manages dependency resolution, conflict handling, and BOM alignment
- Designs multi-module project structure and module dependency graphs

Use when working with Gradle configuration, build performance, or module structure in JVM/Kotlin/Android projects.
