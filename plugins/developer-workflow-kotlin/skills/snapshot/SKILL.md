# Snapshot

Captures what code *currently does* — not what it should do — before any migration or refactoring
begins. Produces a `behavior-spec.md` that becomes the shared contract for the migration and the
acceptance criteria for the `code-migration` acceptance phase.

**GATE: Does not return control until the user has explicitly confirmed the behavior spec.**

---

## Input Contract

**Orchestrator mode** (called from `developer-workflow-kotlin:code-migration`):
- Reads targets and categories from `swarm-report/<slug>-migration-plan.md`
- Writes `swarm-report/<slug>-behavior-spec.md`

**Standalone mode** (user invokes directly):
- If the user has not specified what to snapshot, ask ONE question:
  > "What should I snapshot? Please list the files or classes and their categories: `logic` (pure
  > data/business logic), `ui` (views, screens, layouts), or `api` (public interfaces, module
  > boundaries, Gradle configs)."
- Wait for the answer before proceeding.
- Writes `swarm-report/<slug>-behavior-spec.md`. Generate slug from target name(s) if none provided.

---

## Phase 1: Identify Targets

Read the migration plan or user input and build the snapshot work list:

| Unit | Category | Snapshot method |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `path/to/File.kt` | logic | characterization tests |
| `path/to/Screen.kt` | ui | screenshots / manual checklist |
| `path/to/Repository.kt` | api | public surface listing |

A single unit may have multiple categories — apply all matching methods, in order: `logic` → `ui` → `api`.

---

## Phase 2: Snapshot by Category

### `logic` — Characterization Tests

Write **characterization tests** — tests that capture what the code *actually does*, not what it
ideally should do. Legacy code often encodes years of production fixes and undocumented edge-case
handling. The goal is a behavioral safety net, not a correctness audit.

1. Read the code carefully and write tests that pin actual inputs/outputs, including edge cases,
   nullability behavior, error paths, and any quirks discovered
2. If existing tests already cover the target: run them, confirm green — then check whether
   they're comprehensive enough to catch behavioral regressions in the areas that will change
3. **Async/callback-heavy code** (RxJava, coroutines, listeners, callbacks): write synchronous
   characterization tests that still exercise the async paths — use `blockingGet()` / `TestObserver`
   for RxJava, `runBlocking { }` for coroutines, or a `CountDownLatch`/`CompletableFuture` for
   callbacks. Async behaviors are often the most important to capture; they expose
   timing/threading assumptions the migration must preserve.
4. Run all tests — all must pass before recording as complete
5. Note surprising behaviors (silent null returns, exception swallowing, etc.) — preserve them
   through migration unless the user explicitly decides otherwise
6. **If tests cannot compile or pass:** stop → describe the problem to the user → decide together:
   fix first OR switch to manual checklist (document the limitation clearly)

### `ui` — Screenshots / Manual Checklist

1. **Existing screenshot tests** → run them, save outputs as baseline
2. **No screenshot tests** → use `mcp__mobile__screen` to capture affected screens manually
3. **Mobile MCP unavailable** → create manual checklist: each screen's visible state
   (layout, colors, text, key interactions)
4. **No infrastructure at all** → document limitation to user; proceed with manual checklist fallback

### `api` — Public Surface Listing

1. List every public surface: classes, functions, extension points, Gradle configs
2. List every known caller (search the codebase)
3. Record as behavioral checklist in the behavior spec

---

## Phase 3: Produce behavior-spec.md

After completing all applicable snapshot methods, write `swarm-report/<slug>-behavior-spec.md`
using this template:

```markdown
# Behavior Specification: [TargetName]
FROM: [technology] → TO: [technology]

## Public Interface
| Method / Property | Inputs | Output / Side Effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `methodName(x)` | type, constraints | return type + value | e.g. "returns null for id ≤ 0" |

## Normal Behaviors
- [description of each significant behavior]

## Edge Cases
- [inputs at boundaries, empty collections, zero, max values]

## Quirks (preserve exactly unless user decides otherwise)
- [unexpected nullability, swallowed exceptions, hardcoded values, implicit assumptions]
- [parsing/formatting library defaults that differ from intuition — e.g., `SimpleDateFormat.isLenient() == true`
  means invalid dates silently overflow; `DateTimeFormatter` is strict by default — callers may rely on
  the lenient behavior]
- [thread-safety assumptions — e.g., `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe; callers that share a
  single instance across threads have hidden race conditions that must be preserved or explicitly fixed]
- [timezone implicit dependencies — methods using `TimeZone.getDefault()` silently]

## Out of Scope
- [behaviors that will intentionally change after migration]
```

---

## GATE: Confirmation

Present the completed spec to the user using this prompt:

> "Here is the behavior spec for [TargetName]. Please review it before the migration begins:
> - Are the public interface signatures correct?
> - Are there any quirks you want to mark as bugs to fix (rather than preserve)?
> - Are there behaviors that should intentionally change after migration?
>
> Reply 'confirmed' to proceed, or point out anything to correct."

**Do not return control until the user replies 'confirmed' or provides corrections.**

If the user provides corrections: update the spec and re-present it. Repeat until confirmed.

The confirmation is the shared contract for the migration. After confirmation, the spec is final
and any changes require an explicit new snapshot or user override.
